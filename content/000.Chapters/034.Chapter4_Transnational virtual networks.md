- [ ] Do ICTs create connectedness between coethnics and locals? 

### Section 1: Introduction: Does technology bind?
 1. Technology and migration
	 - Technological explanations for the emergence of more transnational patterns of migration prove to be incomplete when divorced from an analysis of the social relations of production.2 Rather it is the current moment of capitalism as a global mode of production that has necessitated the maintenance of family ties and political allegiances among persons spread across the globe (p. 15) in [1994.Basch, Glick Schiller-Nations Unbound](002.LiteratureNotes/1994.Basch,%20Glick%20Schiller-Nations%20Unbound.md)
 2. "core vs periphery" 
	 - post 1970, capitalist nations found it more profitable to set up production in "periphery" states. "core" economies, such as the US and other Western countries would be essential for managing "the periphery" leading to dramatic changes in the labor markets of these nation-states (p. 26) nations unbound. Also see pg 27 about multination companies bouncing around periphery countries in search of the highest profits
