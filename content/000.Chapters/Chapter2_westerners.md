0. Preface/intro: the lack or absence of [ICTs](001.Notes/ICTs%20and%20Belonging.md) in the imaginary of VN while growing up and connecting to VN for the 2nd generation. 2nd gens relied on the 1st gen or diasporic media to connect with motherland.

1. Departure: a push/pull from the ancestral homeland 
	* The history of the Vietnamese diaspora.
		* Much research to-date has focused heavily on the US, Canada, Australia, and UK. A quick review of these aforementioned countries and also look at other receiving/settlement countries (Czech republic, Germany, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, France, etc).

			1. 1st Wave (to United States)
				- **Refugee (boat people)** (push factor) but who is designated refugee status? Who is a refugee and who determines status? migrant/refuge binary (phi hong [Su](005.Authors/Su.md) book intro + jana [Lipman](005.Authors/Lipman.md)’s (p 1) intro) that some are categorized as refugee/migrant and it affects our imaginary. Also Rebecca [Hamlin](005.Authors/Hamlin.md)'s Crossing. 
			2. 2nd Wave
			3. 3rd Wave: Orderly Departure Program (ODP) and Humanitarian Operation (HO)
		* **Research other countries**
			* As mentioned in the first point, research is heavily America-centric. A short review of literature that goes into waves to other countries (with emphasis on migration to Western nations) 
	* Post 1999 (also see [labor migrants](001.Notes/labor%20migrants.md))
			1. Reflect on the following types of migrants to come out of Viet Nam
		* **Refugees?**
		* **Skilled migrants** (pull factor)
		* **Students/Work/economic migrants

	- Research about identity, acceptance, discrimination
	- Authenticity (Tamsin [Barber](005.Authors/Barber.md)’s work)
