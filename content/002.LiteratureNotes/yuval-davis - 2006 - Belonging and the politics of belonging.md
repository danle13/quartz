# Annotation Summary of Belonging and the politics of belonging(1).pdf.
 *Highlight [3]:* Even in its most stable ‘primordial’ forms, however, belonging is always a dynamic process, not a reified fixity, which is only a naturalized construction of a particular hegemonic form of power relations.
 *and Note [3]:* #belonging as not fixed and a social construct of “particular hegemonic forms of power relations”

 *Highlight [3]:* three major analytical levels on which belonging is constructed. The first level concerns social locations; the second relates to individuals’ identifications and emotional attachments to various collectivities and groupings; the third relates to ethical and political value systems with which people judge their own and others’ belonging/s.
 *and Note [3]:* 3 levels of belonging:
1. Social location
2. individual identifications and emotional attachments to groups
3. ethnical and political value systems which people judge their own and others’ belonging

 *Highlight [3]:* When it is said that people belong to a particular gender, or race, or class or nation, that they belong to a particular age-group, kinship group or a certain profession, what is being talked about are social and economic locations, which, at each historical moment, have particular implications vis-a-vis the grids of power relations in society. A man or a woman, black or white, working-class or middle-class, a member of a European or an African nation: these are not just different categories of social location, but categories that also have a certain positionality along an axis of power, higher or lower than other such categories.
 *and Note [3]:* social locations = identities people have that have a “certain positionally along an axis of power”

 *Highlight [4]:* Social locations, however, even in their most stable format, are virtually never constructed along one power axis of difference, although official statistics*/as well as identity politics*/often tend to construct them in this way. This is why the intersectional approach to social locations is so crucially important. There is no space here to discuss in detail the various intersectional approaches to social divisions. 12However, there are three points relating to intersectional analysis that are important to mention here in relation to issues concerning the analysis of belonging and the politics of belonging.
 *and Note [4]:* [[intersectionality]] approach to social positioning.

 *Highlight [4]:* Although discourses of race, gender, class etc. have their own ontological bases that cannot be reduced to each other, there is no separate concrete meaning of any social division. To be a woman is different if you are middle-class or working-class, a member of the hegemonic majority or a racialized minority, living in the city or in the country, young or old, straight or gay.
 *and Note [4]:* you can’t separate out hegemonic/power axis from social locations. eg. to be a woman is different if you are middle-class or working-class., etc

 *Highlight [6]:* Identities are narratives, stories people tell themselves and others about who they are (and who they are not). 16Not all of these stories are about belonging to particular groupings and collectivities; they can be, for instance, about individual attributes, body images, vocational aspirations or sexual prowess. However, even such stories often relate, directly or indirectly, to self and/or others’ perceptions of what being a member in such a grouping or collectivity (ethnic, racial, national, cultural, religious) might mean.
 *and Note [6]:* [[009.Themes/Identity and Belonging/theory.identity]] are the stories people tell themselves about who they are and who they are not. they don’t have to but can relate directly or indirectly to what self and/or others’ perceptions of membership in a collective or group might mean.

 *Highlight [6]:* Constructions of belonging, however, cannot and should not be seen as merely cognitive stories. They reflect emotional investments and desire for attachments: ‘Individuals and groups are caught within wanting to belong, wanting to become, a process that is fuelled by yearning rather than positing of identity as a stable state.’ 17Elspeth Probyn, as well as Anne-Marie Fortier, 18construct identity as transition, always producing itself through the combined processes of being and becoming, belonging and longing to belong. This duality is often reflected in narratives of identity.
 *and Note [6]:* belonging is not only in the mind. it’s a reflection of “emotional investments and desire for attachments”. people and groups want to belong, want to become, and it’s not a stable, fixed state. transitorily and in transition.

 *Highlight [8]:* John Crowley defined the politics of belonging as ‘the dirty work of boundary maintenance’. 24The boundaries that the politics of belonging is concerned with are the boundaries of the political community of belonging, the boundaries that separate the world population into ‘us’ and ‘them’.

 *Highlight [8]:* Benedict Anderson defined nations as ‘imagined communities’. They are imagined communities, according to Anderson, ‘because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion’.25

 *Highlight [9]:* Citizenship and the politics of belonging There have been many definitions of and debates about citizenship. Although in political theory many focus on the debate between the liberals and the republicans and/or communitarians as being the most important,28 in recent years a number of theoretical and sociological debates have focused, in different ways, on the extent to which citizenship should be understood primarily, or even at all, in relation to the nation-state.29
 *and Note [9]:* debates on citizenship and whether it should be understood primarily or even at all, in relation to the nation-state. #interesting

 *Highlight [9]:* In liberal theory, citizenship is basically constructed as a reciprocal relationship of rights and responsibilities between individuals and the state.
 *and Note [9]:* liberal theory idea of [[001.Notes/citizenship]]

 *Highlight [10]:* This participatory character of citizenship, comprising full and legitimate belonging, has become the focus of the political struggles of many marginalized and excluded groupings. For instance, feminists in Latin America have adopted citizenship as their major political tool in the post-dictatorship period, 34as have many others in the developing world, such as villagers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. 35While, for civil rights activists in the United States, registering African Americans to vote was one of their main signifiers of belonging, the Chicanas, twenty years later, have developed what Renato 30 T.

 *and Note [10]:* participatory character of citizenship as a signifier of #belonging

 *Highlight [11]:* 207 Rosaldo and others have called ‘cultural citizenship’, 36which focuses on community activism as the main signifier of belonging.

 *Highlight [12]:* Much of the debates concerning citizenship and belonging have been focused on which rights, which responsibilities and whether or not the two should be related. 42In recent years there has also been a growing body of literature on the thorny issue of cultural rights and the associated question of individual v. collective rights. 43As I have pointed out elsewhere,44 however, before we consider these different kinds of citizenship rights, we need to consider another kind of rights*/spatial rights*/namely, the right to enter a state or any other territory of a political community and, once inside, the right to remain there. Much of the energy of different political projects relating to the politics of belonging focus on these issues: the right to migrate, the right of abode, the right to work and, more and more recently, the right to plan a future where you live (since people who have been granted full residence rights as refugees can be told after many years of living and working in a state, no matter what their life projects are, that their country of origin is now ‘safe’ and therefore they are obliged to return there).
 *and Note [12]:* #quote
much debate around belonging is about citizenship and rights and responsibilities. 

however, [[005.Authors/yuval-davis]] states that before considering citizenship rights, we should consider [[spatial rights]], the right to enter a state or other territory of a political community and once inside, the right to stay there 

 *Highlight [13]:* When it comes to membership’s rights and responsibilities in the arena of the politics of belonging, the duties involved become much more ephemeral and actually become requirements, rather than mere duties. The central question here is what is required from a specific person for him/her to be entitled to belong, to be considered as belonging, to the collectivity. Common descent (or rather the myth of common descent) might be demanded in some cases, while in others it might be a common culture, religion and/or language. Loyalty and solidarity, based on common values and a projected myth of common destiny, tend to become requisites for belonging in pluralist societies. In other words, in different projects of the politics of belonging, the different levels of belonging*/social locations, identities and ethical and political values*/can become the requisites of belonging. Requisites of belonging that relate to social locations*/origin, ‘race’, place of birth*/would be the most racialized and the least permeable. Language, culture and sometimes religion are more open to voluntary, often assimilatory, identification with particular collectivities. Using a common set of values, such as ‘democracy’ or ‘human rights’, as the signifiers of belonging can be seen as having the most permeable boundaries of all.
 *and Note [13]:* what is required of someone for them to be entitled to [[belong]]? 

- common descent (or myth of this)
- common culture, religion or language
- loyalty and solidarity
	- myth of common destiny

[[permeability of boundaries]]. #race and #place as most radicalized and least permeable. language as more permeable since it is voluntary.
