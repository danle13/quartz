# 2011 - Lan Hoang - Gender Identity and Agency in Migration Decision Making Evidence from Vietnam

## Annotation Summary of Gender Identity and Agency in Migration Decision Making Evidence from Vietnam.pdf.
 *Highlight [1]:* Gender roles are not the only factor explaining why women’s labour migration is undesirable in Vietnam. As we have seen in other parts of Asia (Kibria 1998: 13, 16), women’s labour migration is often discouraged due to concerns about their sexuality. Women are perceived to be not only vulnerable to violence and sexual abuse but also easily deceived due to their credulous and ‘soft’ nature.
 *and Note [1]:* gender norms as well as sexuality as a discouragement to women migrating within VN. 

gender norms that women should fulfill their roles as mothers and homemakers prevent them from taking long-term jobs for fear that they would be perceived as less of a mother. 

sexuality as being a concern that they are perceived to be vulnerable and more like to be deceived and tricked into vices and “immoral” relationships.
