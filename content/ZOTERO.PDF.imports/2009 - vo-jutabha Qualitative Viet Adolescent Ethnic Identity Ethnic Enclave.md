“Marcia’s (1966) operationalization of Erikson’s theory of ego identity. A brief overview of the model is presented here; for a more detailed review of the theory and model see Cote ́ and Levine (1987); van Hoof (1999), and Waterman (1999). According to Erikson (1968), towards the end of adolescence, individuals are expected to achieve a ‘‘sense of an invigorating sameness and continuity’’ (p. 19) that ‘‘is experienced merely as a sense of psychosocial well-being. Its most obvious concomitants are a feeling of being at home in one’s body, a sense of ‘knowing where one is going,’ and an inner assuredness of anticipated recognition from those who count’’ (Erikson 1968, p. 165). Operationalizing these notions, Marcia (1966) developed a status model of identity centered on different levels of exploration and commitment. He outlined a progressive series of stages of identity moving from diffusion (neither engaging in exploration nor having made a commitment), through foreclosure (having made a commitment, often based on parental values, albeit without having undertaken any exploration), through moratorium (undertaking exploration but not having yet made a firm commitment), and finally, to an achieved identity (a firm commitment following the period of exploration). Marcia’s (1966) model is the standard by which other models are often compared to even though stage models do not capture developmental processes in their entirety.” ([Vo-Jutabha et al., 2009, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/IPRK7UQJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HYCQTJAY?page=3&annotation=T3MYSEBF))

“Phinney (1990, 2003), a leading figure in the study of ethnic identity, conceives of such identities as dynamic and multidimensional, capturing the ‘‘sense of self as a member of an ethnic group’’ (2003, p. 63).” ([Vo-Jutabha et al., 2009, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/IPRK7UQJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HYCQTJAY?page=3&annotation=Q5QFSJR7)) [[005.Authors/phinney]] as leading scholar of #ethnicidentity ethnic identity. #identity
