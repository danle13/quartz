> "However, studies of transnational families have not explored the social psychological and emotional consequences of separation (or reunification) with other family members such as aunts and uncles, grandmothers, and cousins, often viewed as members of the immediate household" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=5))

> "I suggest that status, lifestyle, and class guilt can exist alongside survivor guilt, together forming the underpinnings of multiple logics of care toward nonmigrating relatives" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=5))

> "Geopolitics of sending and host countries in these migratory flows continues to play an instrumental role in shaping the reception of these diasporic subjects." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=7))

> "Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, relations among Viet Kieu diasporic communities and the state have shifted from mutual hostility and suspicion toward strategic engagement on the part of the Vietnamese government to attract remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI), and now skilled labor in order to fill short-term middle-level management and executive staff shortages." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=7))

> "My trips to both Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi confirmed my expectations that there was a smaller and less visible Viet Kieu presence in the North." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=8))

> "Grandmothers are leading the recipients of gifts and money; they are often the matriarchs who knit together transnational family relations for the Viet Kieu." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=12))

> "In the absence of this, there remains an imbalance of power and status, typically leaning in the direction of the migrants." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=13))

> "These more nuanced, nonmonetary relations counter the frame that nonmigrating relatives were merely passive recipients of money and gifts— they, too, asserted their agency in structuring the transnational family network." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:189](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=14))

> "Survivor guilt was named as well as talked about implicitly." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:189](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=14))

> "What seems to be named as class guilt where Thu contrasted her life with those of her relatives is actually recognition of social inequality and different opportunities between her immediate family and the lives of her nonmigrating relatives" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:190](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=15))

> "Some link their ideas to filial piety, others about duty and overcompensation for absence, and still others wanted to have broader impact beyond a one-time enjoyment of a gift or experience, which might also reflect their underlying perceptions of income distribution and development." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:190](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=15))

> "Money, gifts, and excessive helping out became a source of anxiety that led some Viet Kieu to shield their assets and/or to distance themselves from relatives in Vietnam." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=16))

> "While many Viet Kieu were uncomfortable about the contrast between their relatively comfortable circumstances and those of poor local relatives, some local families were well-off—a situation that sometimes created a different kind of tension." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=16))

> "The living space that many Viet Kieu who elected to live in high-rises constituted a protective, Westernized residential bubble that was, for the most part, foreign to their local extended relatives" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:192](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=17))

> "For both Vincent and Thi, the desire to conceal their physical living space amenities revealed a mismatch between wanting to "help out" versus the desire to avoid being taxed by family obligations and demands." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=18))

> "These sentiments gave the impression that the personal boundaries were intended to minimize the material artifacts of class and social differences between the Viet Kieu themselves and their relatives" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=19))

> "Her re-encounters with family were colored by bitter memories of mistreatment by extended relatives." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:196](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=21))

> "Ultimately, these social differences magnify the Viet Kieu's realization that going "back" to Vietnam was not about finding "home" and a sense of belonging; returning to the ancestral homeland was marked by developed and developing country social worlds converging within extended families that once separated by geographic distance, now colocated in a rapidly expanding urban space witnessing a greater class divide in Ho Chi Minh City (Luong 2009 )." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:197](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=22))

> "Even though they have been able to foster long-distances ties, face-to-face encounters changed the quality of many kinship networks." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=23))

> "The articles shifts the focus away from the first generation toward the coping strategies of adult children of refugees and shows how "return" visits, facilitated by global economic conditions, can reveal cultural fissures in the transnational extended family, which growing up on different continents can magnify" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2014:198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B8UHY87V?page=23))
