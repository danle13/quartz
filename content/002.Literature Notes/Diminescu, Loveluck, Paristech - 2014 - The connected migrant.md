# Annotation Summary of Diminescu, Loveluck, Paristech - 2014 - The connected migrant From migratory Trajectories To migratory Traceabilities.pdf.
 *Highlight [page 1]:* The connecTed migranT: From migraTory TrajecTories To migraTory TraceaBiLiTies All aspects of the migrant experience are affected by the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies. Even before he/she has left, the would-be migrant now usually forms his/her project after a thorough search on Google, rather than after hearing the stories told by those who have returned from emigration.

 *Highlight [page 4]:* Dana Diminescu | Benjamin Loveluck 1. See www.e-diasporas. fr for further details, and for access to the working papers and the data. See also Diminescu (2012a, 2012b) for definitions and for a description of the methodology. e-Diasporas Atlas received funding from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the Telecom ParisTech engineering school and the Fondation Maison des sciences de l’homme (FMSH), Paris. 2. The process involved the development of custom-built tools that have now been put to a wider use, such as Navicrawler (http://webatlas.fr/ wp/navicrawler), a program for crawling the web and collecting hyperlinks, and Gephi (https://gephi.org), a visualization software package. threads (Brinkerhoff 2009), on discourse analysis (Trandafoiu 2013) or on a variety of such methods (Alonso and Oiarzabal 2010) have already fleshed out crucial insights about diasporas in the new media environment. Identity formation, in this context, has been particularly scrutinized and generally appears as hybrid, layered and in constant (re)negotiation – thus entrenched in the transnationalist paradigm.

 *Highlight [page 5]:* Leaving aside the question of defining what a diaspora consists in, we are concerned here with the particular issue of diasporic identity, understood as diasporic self-definition. Indeed, although the notion of identity carries difficulties of its own, we would like to address it in a limited sense, which nevertheless brings forth a whole range of specific questions. As a first approximation, we take the formation of diasporic identities as involving that migrants recognize each other as being part of a dispersed collective, which is then more or less firmly established as a common project. The initial displacement leaves a mark, which is upheld as a strong feature of one’s identity.

- migrants recognize each other as being part of a dispersed collective or as a “common project”
