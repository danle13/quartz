 "This study focused on highly skilled returnees, aiming to analyze how transnational flows of capital such as language, education, and access played into the symbolic boundary making and identity politics of return" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=1))

 "The Overseas Vietnamese returnees in my study reinforced global class inequalities and social boundaries through behaviors such as their residential decisions to live in newly built high-rise apartments in expatriate neighborhoods" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=2))

 "However, they constructed mora" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=2))

 "boundaries to distinguish themselves from foreigners and cultural boundaries to distinguish themselves from locals, but they also crossed these boundaries to find spaces of belonging in Vietnam." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1117](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=3))

 "Asian American return migration." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=4))

 "In the Global South, particularly in Vietnam, the term "expat" has become an umbrella term to refer to a particular type of transnational migrant: American nationals, particularly those of European ancestry, Viet Kieu, and East Asian tourists, businesspeople, and INGO development workers" ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=5))

 "In addition, access to foreign money and a foreign passport provided many elite locals and foreigners with distinct spaces of consumption inaccessible to local middle-class Vietnamese; this is notable in Hanoi but even more significant in Ho Chi Minh City," ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=6))

 "I was careful to probe for hidden or taken-for-granted meanings in the moral script of diasporic returnee politics and social life. Because of the respondent bias toward earning the good graces of the researcher, my own identity and subjectivity as a high-skilled Viet Kieu returnee influenced the material." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=7))

 "Although the Vietnamese government hoped that the Viet Kieu would help bridge foreign and local markets, cultural differences between Viet Kieu and locals—even among those who possessed high levels of language fluency and awareness of Vietnamese customs—prompted many to seek expatriate-friendly areas that provided the modern conveniences of a more developed country." ([Nguyen-Akbar 2017:1124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSNHQKKW?page=10))
