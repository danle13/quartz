 *Note [page 4]:* 
 *Note [page 5]:* according to oxford programme, migrants are embedded in networks stretching across multiple states and identities and cultural production reflect multiple locations

 *Note [page 8]:* national boundaries are not contiguous with boundaries of social fields

 *Note [page 8]:* 
 *Note [page 8]:* to effectively use social field theory: 
1. define paramenters of field studied and scope of networks embedded
2. empiracally analyze the strength and impact of direct and indirect transn. relations

 *Note [page 10]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* transnational framework and methodologies. 

only need to ask individuals about transnational aspects of their lives and thoes they are connected to in a single setting.

 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* need tools that capture simultaneous engagement

 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 11]:* transnational migration is a process and NOT an event

 *Note [page 11]:* cannot be a one-time event. needs to be an on-going process

 *Note [page 11]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* ethnography as being suited for studying creation and durability of transnational social fields

 *Note [page 12]:* migrants embedded in multiple legal and political institutions merely by being part of a nation as power 

 *Note [page 12]:* power pervasive and permeates

 *Note [page 12]:* captured during shifting, challenging, goal-setting times

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* longitudinal study

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* participant observation and ethnographic interviewing allow for look into simultaneous:

-maintaining/shedding cultural repertoires and identities
-interact within a location and across its boundaries
-act in ways that are in concert with or contradict values over time

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* no intention of returning home. why no intention? what if they do want to return? does this change the dynamic of research?

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* power and hegemony of more than one state when migrants belong to multiple settings

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* can act upon them. have agency

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 12]:* most migrants move from place where state has little power with global interstate system to a more power state. true for VKs in VN?

At the same time they gain more social power over people property and locality to their homeland than before migrating

 *Note [page 12]:* 
 *Note [page 13]:* migrants can influence state's position in world economic order AND internal functions as well

 *Note [page 13]:* this intersection between losses and gains that transnational social fields needs to grapple with

 *Note [page 13]:* 
 *Note [page 13]:* 
 *Note [page 13]:* 
 *Note [page 14]:* 
 *Note [page 14]:*

 *Note [page 14]:* 
 *Note [page 15]:* children are "central axis" of family migration and critical reason why families move back and forth

 *Note [page 15]:* 
 *Note [page 16]:* "relativizing" refers to ways in which individuals establish, maintain, or curtail ties to specific family members

 *Note [page 16]:* not territorially bounded. based on actual or imagined experiences that are shared across borders regardless of where someone was born or now lives

 *Note [page 16]:* rethinking of notion of "generation" and "second generation"

 *Note [page 16]:* 
 *Note [page 16]:* socialization and social reproduction occur transnationally in response to TWO cultural contexts:

1. even children don't return to parents' ancestral homes just by being around people, values, cultural artifacts and claims from somewhere else are present on a daily basis
2. simlarly childrens parents who are nonmigrants are raised and surrounded by social networks and resources from the host country. Levitt (1999) calls "social remitances". 

 *Note [page 16]:* 
 *Note [page 16]:* 
 *Note [page 16]:* clear separation between migrant and nonmigrant's socialization and social networks may not exist. THEREFORE cannot accurately capture expreience of living in transnational social field

 *Note [page 16]:* 
 *Note [page 17]:* 
 *Note [page 17]:* reared in transnational space

 *Note [page 17]:* 
 *Note [page 17]:* rebuttal against scholars who say that future generations will render transnational ties inconsequential.

 *Note [page 17]:* not necessarily true with VKs living in VN

 *Note [page 17]:* 
 *Note [page 17]:* 
 *Note [page 17]:* VK research! on spousal search and child rearing. read me!

 *Note [page 17]:* 
 *Note [page 18]:* within the sending states that the greatest changes in state policy occur

 *Note [page 18]:* advantage and utility in sending states having migrants in other countries

 *Note [page 18]:* 
 *Note [page 18]:* 
 *Note [page 18]:* 
 *Note [page 18]:* other states develop "global nations' policies" and want national loyalty instead of migrant return

 *Note [page 20]:* 
 *Note [page 20]:* adopt and abandon

 *Note [page 21]:* "reverse brain drain" or "brain ciruculation" or "brain gain"

 *Note [page 21]:* state courts emigrants b/c can see them advancing economic and foreign policy interested

 *Note [page 21]:* 
 *Note [page 21]:* 
 *Note [page 21]:* substate courting of emigrants are more about promoting extraterritorial regional or local loyalties than "nation-building"

 *Note [page 21]:* 
 *Note [page 22]:* transnational nation-states

 *Note [page 22]:* 
 *Note [page 22]:* 
 *Note [page 22]:* VN falls in this category. want involvement but don't want to grant legal rights

 *Note [page 22]:* become so depending on emigrant contributions

 *Note [page 22]:* 
 *Note [page 23]:* disinterested and denouncing

 *Note [page 23]:* 
 *Note [page 23]:* not a part of homeland

 *Note [page 23]:* 
 *Note [page 24]:* some people, even though they have never lived in the sending country, make claims and take advantages of rights that citizens get even though they aren't citizens

 *Note [page 24]:* can't just focus on legal rights and formal membership because some people act like members of a society w/o formally belonging to it. 

THUS influencing and are influenced BY the state

 *Note [page 24]:* 
 *Note [page 24]:* 
 *Note [page 24]:* "transborder citizens"

 *Note [page 24]:* 
 *Note [page 25]:* migrants come and influence host states and send these "social remitances" back to their homelands or members of their networks settled in other states

 *Note [page 25]:* 
 *Note [page 27]:* 
 *Note [page 27]:* interrelatedness of transnational practices and processes to social life

 *Note [page 27]:* migration is but one of the many processes that transcent notaional boundaries
