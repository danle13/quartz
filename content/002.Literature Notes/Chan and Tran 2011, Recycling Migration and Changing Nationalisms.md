# Annotation Summary of Chan and Tran 2011, Recycling Migration and Changing Nationalisms.pdf.
 *Highlight [page 3]:* This paper examines the changes in state policies towards overseas subjects and returnees. It argues that the state of origin is an active transnational actor forging a transnational space that accommodates overseas Vietnamese back to the Vietnamese whole. Such state-initiated transnational practices not only tie the diaspora to homeland development, but also construct a pan-Vietnamese discourse aimed at solidifying the Vietnamese nation worldwide.

 *Highlight [page 4]:* Two interesting terms provided by our informants nicely distinguish these two groups: refugee Viet kieu and government Viet kieu. This article does not investigate the latter group.

 *Highlight [page 5]:* Amidst the positive turn of official policies, more intimate terms such as dong bao, Viet bao and kieu bao have been used in official discourse, and kieu bao has become a standard official term with which to address Viet kieu.

 *Highlight [page 7]:* Over 90 per cent said that Viet kieu in general lead a more advanced lifestyle than the Vietnamese,

 *Highlight [page 7]:* Furthermore, 67 per cent agree that Viet kieu are part of the Vietnamese nation

 *Highlight [page 8]:* On the whole, local people agree that, ethnically speaking, Viet kieu are part and parcel of the Vietnamese nation. However, they consider them to be a different cultural group, because they have been ‘Westernised’.

 *Highlight [page 14]:* The nation and the spirit for the nation (which some others call ‘nationalism’) are thus continuously reconstructed by endemic as well as transnational forces.

 *Highlight [page 14]:* By exploring the changing relationship between the homeland and the home-returning diaspora, and the impacts both have on each other, we argue that statehood nationalism and diasporic nationalism are increasingly intertwined in an ongoing process
