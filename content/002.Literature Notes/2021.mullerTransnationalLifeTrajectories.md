 numbers of VK returnees to VN The numbers of returning  [Viet Kieu](001.Notes/Viet%20Kieu.md) for tourist activities have increased since economic reforms were initiated by the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) in 1986. Whereas in 1990 only around 70,000 Viê.tkiêu returned for short trips or holidays to Vietnam, political reforms and a steadily improving economic situation led those numbers to swell to over one million in 2009 (Schiele 2017: 7). From 2005 to 2010, there were around 500,000 Viê. tkiêu travelling to Vietnam annually (MOFA 2012: 30).

Viê.tkiêu is a popular term of reference for overseas Vietnamese used by the state and people in Vietnam for overseas Vietnamese” (Koh 2015a: 203)

Similar to Wang’s (2017: 1175) description of the gendered return experiences of American-born Chinese, a mixture of Socialist egalitarianism and Confucian patri- archal concepts influence the return mobilities of the interlocutors of this study. In line with the Vietnamese tradition of patrilineal ancestor worship, sons (i.e. men) are considered to be “inside lineage” (bên nô. i) thus holding inherent morality, honour and reputation (Rydstrom 2002: 360), while women are thought to be related to the “outside lineage” (bên ngoa. i). This gender dichotomy is also applied to the concep- tion of character traits of men and women in Vietnam. The characters of women are described as cold (tính la. nh), which is opposed to the hot character (tính nóng) of men. Due to this inherent “heat” of men, it is generally accepted that they cross moral borders more easily or behave dangerously. Examples of this can be found in excessive alcohol consumption, drunken participation in traffic, gambling or sexual adventures and prostitution. Nguy˜ên and Harris, for example, conclude that “Sexuality is one of the main components of a Vietnamese real ‘man’ […]. Therefore, seeking sex workers is considered a rite of passage: married men will take unmarried men to houses of prostitution to initiate their transformation into ‘real’ men” (2009: 136). Due to their status as being perceived outside the patrilineal family, daughters and women are expected to continuously show moral behaviour and adhere to strict ethical conduct (Rydstrom 2002: 260).
