 *Highlight [7]:* With easier travel and communication, it has become more common for the haigui, literally meaning “sea turtles” (returnees who settle) to become a hai’ou, meaning “seagull,” who can easily migrate between China and other countries. Meanwhile, for those returnees who are relatively immobile, it has also become quite common to maintain various social connections overseas. Thus, old notions of “return” signifying the severing of overseas connections and permanent belonging to the motherland can no longer reﬂect the lived experiences of multiple embeddedness for contemporary returnees. What seems lacking are studies on “how returnees manage and balance the complexity of ‘multiple embeddedness’” (Darieva et al., 2012: 16). Migration studies need to re-examine return migration beyond “economic, human capital and nationalistic framings” (Chen and Koyama, 2013: 26).

 *Highlight [7]:* Accordingly, concepts of diaspora, returning diaspora or post-diaspora can be invoked to better grasp the lived, continuing and evolving experiences of mobility than the presumed immobile “returnee.” Here, the concept of transnational diaspora, which combines insights from transnationalism and diaspora, serves as a useful framework. The early articulation of this term can be traced to Lie (1995), who highlighted the salience of premigration social connections, cultures, different types of capital and return migration as a sojourn within a circular lifelong travel rather than a ﬁnal great journey. Key aspects of transnational diaspora, as pointed out by Lie, are “multifarious trajectories,” “sustained diverse networks,” “diversity of migrant identities” and a “multitude of migration experiences.” Following Lie’s conceptions, Guo (2016) has proposed the notion of double diaspora based on the transnational migration experiences of Chinese Canadians living in Beijing, which challenged the notion of return to the homeland as a ﬁnal or unidirectional journey.

 *Highlight [8]:* The insights of transnational diaspora as an analytic tool derive from transnationalism (Faist et al., 2013; Vertovec, 2009) and diaspora (Dufoix, 2011; Faist, 2010). Particularly, we draw upon several related analytical concepts, including transnational social ﬁeld (Levitt and Glick Schiller, 2004), transnational habitus (Guarnizo, 1997; Nedelcu, 2012) and mixed embeddedness (Glick Schiller and C¸aglar, 2013), that broadly fall under the transnational paradigm. Together they reﬂect the transnationalization of social lives and foreground identiﬁcation with transnational social relations forged through past experiences and ongoing participation in transnational practices. We also draw upon the concept of digital diaspora (Nedelcu, 2019), an emerging form of diaspora that recognizes the transformative impact of Internet-based communication technology in creating virtual spaces for migrants to maintain diasporic engagement, express diasporic consciousness and re-imagine multiple homes and origins in the new transnational age. As Clifford (1994) pointed out, diaspora as an analytic discourse is not limited to one historical experience. Instead, it is always inviting new theorizing as it is embedded in new socio-historical and geographical contexts.

 *Highlight [20]:* It can be seen from the ﬁndings that the concept of “returnee” is very restricted in understanding the transnational work and learning practices and the self-identiﬁcation of Chinese transnational academics. The experience of return denotes just a stopping point in migrants’ circulatory and recurring transnational journey and their transnational practices after return should be captured by the broader concept of diaspora, which “confront nation-state projects that continue to demand exclusive forms of national loyalty [and] . . .critiques essentializing nature of culturally and ethno-religious-based paradigms” (Darieva et al., 2012: 3–4).

 *Highlight [20]:* As illustrated by the participants’ experiences, Chinese transnational academics’ ways of being and ways of belonging are not necessarily centered on and within the geographical boundary of China. In fact, many participants have manifested a diasporic consciousness marked by “dual or multiple identities” (Vertovec, 2009: 5) with their multiple attachments to China, their place of employment, their host countries where they completed their doctoral studies, the Chinese knowledge diaspora and transnational communities in their particular research ﬁelds. This echoes the argument of Bitran and Tan (2013) that migrants’ transnational connections may be more signiﬁcant than their citizenship or place of being in accounting for their senses of belonging.

 *Highlight [21]:* This study also resonates with the ﬁndings of Nedelcu (2019) that digital communication technologies offer a new space for academics to form a transnationally connected research ﬁeld and to actualize an imaginary of transnationally accessible career opportunities. This digital turn includes not only the actively mobile, but also the relatively immobile into the purview of transnational migration studies as the latter can be actively engaged in

The ability for people to actually travel across borders reinforces the sense of being transnationally present in the virtual space. Social participation in the virtual space also offers opportunities and possibilities for transmigrant individuals to make choices in differentiation of individual identities and individual life courses (Hake, 1999). Due to many restrictions, such as limited funding for travel and the bureaucratic reporting process for the use of their service passports, virtual means and platforms enabled transnational academics based in China to practice everyday transnationalism. Such practices helped sustain transnational academics’ intentions for future relocation and a desire to maintain transnational ties, thus strengthening their diasporic consciousness and transnational habitus.

 *Highlight [23]:* concept of diaspora to transnational studies lends to extending the academic discussions on the relationship between the two ﬁelds of study to recognize that diaspora and transnationalism are not just “two awkward dance partners” (Faist, 2010: 9), but that they can also be mutually enabling concepts for analyzing increasingly complicated manifestations of being and belonging in the transnational space.

 *Highlight [23]:* In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual diaspora has become a reality more than ever. The restrictions on cross-border travels and the imposition of border closures underscore the difﬁculty of maintaining transnational connections through physical migration and face-to-face communications on the one hand, and the growing trend of transnational academic collaboration through virtual means, on the other. We are seeing the increasing signiﬁcance of existing and new online platforms in providing spaces for people to sustain transnational connectivity as many local issues now demand communication and collaboration at a transnational level.
