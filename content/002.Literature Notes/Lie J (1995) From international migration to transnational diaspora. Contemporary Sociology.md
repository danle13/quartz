# Annotation Summary of John Lie international Migration to Transnational Diaspora
#### p. 304
 *Highlight [p. 304]:* At the same time, transnationalism identifies a multiplicity of migrant networks and communities that transcend received national boundaries. The idea of diaspora-as an unending sojourn across different lands-better captures the emerging reality of transnational networks and communities than the language of immigration and assimilation (see Khachig Th1h1yan's opening essay in Diaspora 1:1, 1991; and Carol Breckenridge and Arjun Appadurai's initial piece in Public Culture 1:1, 1988).
 *and Note [p. 304]:* diaspora as unending sojourn 

 *Highlight [p. 304]:* In articulating transnational diaspora, it is no longer assumed that emigrants make a sharp break from their homelands. Rather, premigration networks, cultures, and capital remain salient. The sojourn itself is neither unidirectional nor final. Multiple, circular, and return migrations, rather than a singular great journey from one sedentary space to another, occur across transnational spaces. People's movements, in other words, follow multifarious trajectories and sustain diverse networks. Along with the complexity of crossings, the valence of premigration backgrounds has highlighted the diversity of migrant identities. Rather than the singular immigrant, scholars now detail the diversity of immigration circumstances, class backgrounds, gendered transitions, and the sheer multitude of migration experiences.

 *Highlight [p. 304]:* poststructuralists (Michel Foucault, above all), neo-Marxists (Fredric Jameson or Stuart Hall), and postcolonial theorists (Homi Bhabha or Gayatri Spivack).
