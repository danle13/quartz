# What does translocality mean and why does it matter? Lessons learnt from the Translocality: (im) Mobility in transnational and urban contexts workshop in Johannesburg

By Kudzai Vanyoro

The [African Centre for Migration & Society](http://www.migration.org.za), a core partner of the [Migrating out of Poverty Research Programme Consortium](http://migratingoutofpoverty.dfid.gov.uk/) hosted a **_Translocality: (im)Mobility in transnational and urban contexts_** workshop from 1 to 2 June 2016, led by Prof Loren Landau , Dr Zaheera Jinnah and ACMS visiting researcher Dr Lothar Smith (Department of Human Geography, Radboud University, Netherlands). On day one Dr Lothar Smith presented **_Translocality: what is it, does it matter, why does it matter now?_** Prof Loren Landau gave the second presentation **_Translocality on the ground: understanding local developments through the concept of archipelago_**, providing a feel of the South African context. This was followed by a group and plenary discussion to end the day. Day two was initiated by Dr Zaheera Jinnah with her presentation **_The changing meaning of remittances along the way: the case of Somali transmigrants_****. This was** followed by Dr Lothar Smith’s **_The ‘magic’ of remittances: a gender and developmental lens to explore their role interpretation_**_,_ and a discussion.

I will reflect on a few things that stood out for me. In migration studies, the concept of translocality is a complicated matter. Its definition is really hard to find. For Peth[[1]](https://vanyoro.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/what-does-translocality-mean-and-why-does-it-matter-lessons-learnt-from-the-translocality-im-mobility-in-transnational-and-urban-contexts-workshop-in-johannesburg/#_ftn1), translocality constitutes a wide range of enduring, open and non-linear processes whose product is close relations between different places and people. As a migrant, I was unaware of the applicability of this concept to my day-to-day experiences. During the workshop, I learnt that through varying ‘relations’ with different spaces and places (two contested terms), migrants produce multiple perceptions of belonging by expediently choosing to (dis) connect with home.

“In transnational migration the migrant might lose sense of who they are”. A conversation with a friend comes back to mind. When asked where I see myself in the next five years, I was tongue-tied in search of a response. Because of my migration to Johannesburg, I find myself faced with challenges of defining home. Is it my rural home in rural Zimbabwe, or my urban family home? Is it my apartment in Johannesburg? But, as Greiner (2010: 131) posits after translocal interactions, “…Many migrants develop identities that combine rural and urban lifestyles”[[2]](https://vanyoro.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/what-does-translocality-mean-and-why-does-it-matter-lessons-learnt-from-the-translocality-im-mobility-in-transnational-and-urban-contexts-workshop-in-johannesburg/#_ftn2) . The concept of translocality allows us to see through possibilities of cosmopolitanism; of being here and there at the same time, ultimately leaving migrants in ‘nowhereville’ (Landau).

As Landau argued during the two day workshop, migrants may connect or disconnect in the new spaces in which they find themselves in. Not all migrant identities will alter or falter in varying spaces. Equally, the agency of the local people in host communities must not be neglected. The agency of both migrants and locals may positively collide and both parties may find themselves fascinated by the culture that each brings to the table. Such interactions take place is Braamfontein, the area where Wits is located. Many migrants intermingle with locals, who are themselves of different types of ancestral descent. In these interactions, both groups pick positive cultural traits from their experiences with the ‘other’.

Last, the workshop demonstrated how social media networks have translocalised societies in un-imaginable and underexplored fashions. Far from aiding in the communication of remittance transfer to families (a concept Dr. Jinnah dealt with), social media is a society for some.  Dr. Smith underscored that migrants who find themselves ‘in-between’ societies, not belonging to either home or abroad (‘nowhereville’), may resort to virtual society. Surprisingly, little research has been carried out on social media (as a space) and migration, particularly in African migration studies. For example, I exist both in a virtual and geographical location.  I use new media to constantly reconnect on a Whatsapp group called ‘Boys DzeHarare’ (Shona for ‘The Boys from Harare’). This is a group of my old Zimbabwean friends who migrated to South Africa, Botswana, Namibia or Europe. In this space, we discuss each other’s socio-economic lives (like who is making it where, who is married now, which pop culture art is the best at home these days?).

In sum, the workshop proved invaluable to understanding the different physical and virtual spaces I am linked to. The concept of translocality is a complex yet interesting one. With the emergence of new media, it is no longer simple to define localities as spaces , hence there is a need to pursue further research in this area, while engaging various migrant new media groups such as the one I belong to.
