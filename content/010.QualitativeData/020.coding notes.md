ATLAS.ti 9 project bundle, networks of potential categories, grounded theory methodology paper, and preliminary analysis writing.  
In Atlas.ti file, there are 753 codes divided by 5 major code groups: 

1. Barriers and Enablers of Integration, 
2. ICTs, 
3. Identity, 
4. Making Friends, 
5. Motivation for Moving / Staying in Vietnam. 

In the file "Constructing Grounded Theory_ A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis" methodology for constructing grounded theory.  

In Preliminary Analysis writing, summed up the most interesting findings that occurred.

Read relevant literature, reviewing interviews and coding, and after that, conducting focused coding that will allow you to create themes more effectively and easily.

Try rereading the interviews with codes applied to them, and think about the ways to deconstruct the remaining interviews in the same way. Be aware that many codes can be merged, but at this time, maybe it is good for them not to be merged, as it can be useful to see different ideas and approaches that could be applied in analysis. Read relevant literature before focused coding and merging codes. 

In the preliminary analysis writing, some suggestions in which way to go theoretically.
