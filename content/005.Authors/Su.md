# Literature Notes
- from The Border Within
	- Tài’s and Kiều’s national allegiances changed precisely because the “discourse of nationalism is inherently international.”37 Both Vietnamese governments sought recognition from other states that they alone, rather than their adversaries across the 17th parallel, were the legitimate arbiters of Vietnamese nationhood. Journalist Joshua Keating’s metaphor of the world map as a club of countries captures this underlying logic. To be a member of the club, an aspiring country needs recognition by other members. The members may not always get along with one another, but together they serve as gatekeepers to entering the club. In the geopolitical context of the mid-1950s, two competing clubs operated, one led by the Soviet Union and the other by the United States. To achieve recognition in these clubs, the North and South Vietnamese states needed to set themselves apart from each other. To do so, they needed to deal with defectors or arrivals like Tài and Kiều. These new states also needed to monitor and reckon with those who remained. They often achieved this through documentation practices, legislation, and other forms of bureaucratic organization that shape the modern nation-state.38
