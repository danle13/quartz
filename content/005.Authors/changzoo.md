## Literature Notes
- from [Jo](005.Authors/Jo.md)'s "homing: affective topography of ethnic korean return migration (p. 8)":
	- Recent studies (N. Kim 2009; C. Song 2009) suggest that many later-generation returnees possess an “imagined” affinity with and nostalgic sentiment for their ancestral homeland—a vicarious sense of attachment to Korea they have developed through the influence of family members and the larger diaspora community.
