## Ethnic Return Migration
- from [[005.Authors/Jo]]'s work:
	- Takeyuki Tsuda (2009, 1) points to two kinds of returning: 
		- single-generation return migration, which involves first-generation diasporans, and ethnic return migration, which involves later-generation diasporans migrating to the ancestral homeland. The concept of return applies easily in the first case, but less so in the second. The word “return” denotes “to go or come back, as to a former place, position, or state” and therefore does not adequately signify the specificities of the migration trajectory as taken by later-generation diaspora Koreans, who have neither left nor lived in their ancestral homeland and whose understanding of and attachment to Korea has therefore been produced primarily through transgenerational sharing of images and narratives.
