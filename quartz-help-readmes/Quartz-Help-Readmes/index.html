Using works of scholars and naming ICTs parents had that connected them with VN build the narrative that 2nd generation heard the stories from their parents but didn’t have the resources to back up evidence on their own. There was a lack of ICTs present in the imaginary of VN. As they become of age, they gain social media (fb in 2008) and could take the information in their own hands.

And it was also during this same period in which an influx of western-born/raised Vietnamese from the diaspora began migrating in.\n\na. Unboundedness- ﻿Appadurai, for example, has argued that there is a need to reconceptualize the “landscapes of group identity,” a need that flows from the current world conjuncture in which “groups are no longer tightly territorialized, spatially bounded, historically unselfconscious, or culturally homogeneous” (1991:191).

Transnationalism\n\na. ﻿We define “transnationalism” as the processes by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement. We call these processes transnationalism to emphasize that many immigrants today build social fields that cross geographic, cultural, and political borders. Immigrants who develop and maintain multiple relationships—familial, economic, social, organizational, religious, and political—that span borders we call “**transmigrants**.” An essential element of transnationalism is the multiplicity of involvements that transmigrants’ sustain in both home and host societies. We are still groping for a language to describe these social locations. Transmigrants use the term “home” for their society of origin, even when they clearly have also made a home in their country of settlement. The migration literature describes the country of settlement as the “host,” but such a term, though compact and convenient, carries the often unwarranted connotations that the immigrant is both “welcome” and a “visitor.” Transmigrants take actions, make decisions, and develop subjectivities and identities embedded in networks of relationships that connect them simultaneously to two or more nation-states (p. 8) In glick-schiller and basch’s nation’s unbounded.\n\nb. Viet Nam (monosyllabic; why 2 words)\n\nc. Viet Kieu is a disputed term that will be used in this book. Viet Kieu literally means Sojourner of Vietnamese ancestry or overseas Vietnamese. It comes from the Chinese root, ___, and refers to those who have left Vietnam for another country. Some, including several informants in this manuscript, find the label to represent a power imbalance, especially when the word is used as a self-identifier. The term usually evokes images of a person who has left Viet Nam, typically to a country positioned higher geopolitically than Vietnam, owning at least one car, and living in the lap of luxury (citation required). Thus, the label is charged with privilege and economic inequality. Some of the informants in this research preferred labelling themselves Người ______ Gốc Việt (fill in the blank with the birth country. ie. Norwegian with Vietnamese roots) when asked where they were from by locals. With this in mind, Viet Kieu will be used herein for two reasons.\n\nd. First, while Viet Kieu is recognized as being unequal, it is a term that represents and bonds Coethnics within the diaspora. Some of the groups explored in this research use the term to label their own group (ie. Viet Kieus in Viet Nam, Viet Kieus for in Saigon etc.). Viet Kieu easily identifies those of Vietnamese ancestry who have lived abroad for any certain amount of time. It is a term \n\na. “Kieu bao” used by the State now to woo returnees and their Đông to Vietnam.\n\nb. Caroline’s words on VK in Transnationalizing Viet Nam book.\n\nc.

As social scientists, we see ourselves dialectically as both observers and the observed. At the same time, those about whom we write are both the subjects of our inquiry and subjects who, in relationship to what is being said and done around them, including the work of social scientists, and in relation to their own varying motivations, act upon and change the world of our inquiry. We, in turn, observe these actions and are influenced by them. What is more, we evaluate the actions, the beliefs, and the stance of our ﻿subjects. We are, as are all social scientists, whether or not it is acknowledged, positioned observers. Our perceptions, whether we objectify them by identifying them as “data” or as “texts,” are influenced by our position in the world and our positions about the state of the world.

The “spider-web” networks of transmigrants must be located within the hegemonic processes of multiple nation-states, and we must move beyond descriptions of networks to a view of migrants as active agents in a process of hegemonic construction (p. 30, Nations unbound: transnational projects, postcolonial predicaments, and deterritorialized nation-states).\n\n· hegemony is the relationship between those who dominate within the state and those who are dominated. relations are ultimately maintained by force, the social order is sustained by daily practice, habit, and common sense.

Transnationalism refers to the multiple connections that migrants have to two countries or more. The definition of diaspora is contested among scholars that cannot agree on its criteria. Thus there are shortfalls and blindspots with these terms when discussing migration. How can these terms better help us understand the phenomenon of "return" migration, specifically the experiences of the 2nd and subsequent generations? Or those who may not identify with the "diaspora" but still nourish some ties to the ethnic homeland? How can we problematize these terms to help us better understand the increasing use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital attitudes of these groups? In this workshop, our aim is to promote a lively discussion around and question these well-used terms in the digital age we live in. \n\n\nOutline of Workshop\n- framing workshop around we are not the "experts" and instead are looking for support \n- defining terms **transnationalism**, diaspora\n- introduce our research\n	- how do we deal with these concepts in our own respective research?\n	- \n- how does the concept of "diaspora" connect with the 2nd/subsequent generations\n- Dan\'s: how is diaspora affected with ICTs with various online groups (youtube, FB, IG)\n- asking questions to the audience? how do all of you deal with these qusetions in your own researcH?\n- [diasporicity](diasporicity) [tsuda](005.Authors/tsuda.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n# Call for Papers Invitation\n**_Two Hybrid Workshops’ Invitation:_**\n\n**Academic Networking on Researching Migration, Identities** **Intra-Generational Conflicts** **and** **Negotiating of Intra-ethnic Partnerships** **or Sexualities**\n\n**in the Vietnamese Diaspora**\n\n**Venue:** The workshop will be organized in hybrid form, while the physical part will took place\n\n at the Department of Asian Studies, Faculty of Art, Palacký University třída Svobody\n\n 686/26, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic\n\n**Time:** 18-19 November 2021, 9:30am – 3:00pm\n\n**Call for Papers and Presentation Proposals**\n\nSince the 1970s, roughly four million people of Vietnamese descent are living in parts of diaspora all around the world. Originally, a significant part of the diaspora consists of political refugees. But, in the recent years, the majority of those migrants are economic migrants – either migrant workers or petty businessmen. As a result, the diaspora is divided, but even its younger strata is composed of relatively open communities, concentrated mainly around big trade and industrial centers, where Vietnamese communal live and ethnic economy merged together. Naturally, there are significant differences across different regions and locations of the diaspora. For example, unlike in the Czech Republic, Germany and Japan, the Vietnamese diaspora in Taiwan or in the U.S. is not (or no more) isolated. Also, due to the existence of the third and fourth generations in the diaspora, the situation is even more specific in France (and other so-called western countries), where the young people of Vietnamese descent may identify as French, but not fully.\n\nAs we can see from existing scholarship, the co-existence of the diaspora in all the host countries is a complicated matter. Due to the racial prejudices and xenophobia on the both sides, the Vietnamese diaspora´s members are (to certain degree) isolated from the society-at-large. Nevertheless, racial prejudices are not the sole perpetrator of the ostracization of migrants. Class, socio-economic statuses and, to some degree, cultural segregation are also prominent factors in shaping migrants’ experiences. Moreover, aspects such as sexuality and gender play important roles in conditioning the social lives, migration decision makings and practices, as well as identities of Vietnamese migrants in various parts of the world.\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the future research projects on Vietnamese diaspora, the two workshops aim to combine various approaches on researching the diaspora at economically and culturally different localities in Europe, U.S. and East Asia and put together various scholars at various stages of their academic careers focused on Vietnamese migration and diaspora. The ultimate aim is to set up an information exchange platform and a cooperative network that will allow joint research activities and joint publication activities in the future.\n\n**Deadline**\n\nPlease send your presentation proposals (180-300 words long) together with your CV to filip.kraus@upol.cz by **5th November, 2021.**\n\n**Inquiries**For further inquiries, please send an email to: [filip.kraus@upol.cz](mailto:filip.kraus@upol.cz)',title:"2021.11.5_Two Hybrid Workshop, Olomouc University, Czech Republic"},"/001.Notes/How-to-Write-a-Scholarly-Book-Review-for-Publication-in-a-Peer-Reviewed-Journal-A-Review-of-the-Literature":{content:"from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Purpose:\n\nTo describe and discuss the processes used to write scholarly book reviews for publication in peer-reviewed journals and to provide a recommended strategy and book appraisal worksheet to use when conducting book reviews.\n\n### Methods:\n\nA literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Index to Chiropractic Literature was conducted in June 2009 using a combination of controlled vocabulary and truncated text words to capture articles relevant to writing scholarly book reviews for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n### Results:\n\nThe initial search identified 839 citations.

With the expectations of the many stakeholders in the book review process (readers, authors, journal editors, and publishers) mounted on the reviewer's shoulders, the production of a well balanced, engaging, and informative critique, within the confines of a predetermined word limit, is no simple task. Some book review editors describe book reviewing as a fine art.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2)\n\nThe scholarly book review is considered by some to be a form of academic writing that serves to describe and critically evaluate the content, quality, meaning, and significance of a book.[3–6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3) A well constructed book review can provide a thoughtful perspective and will be appreciated by all; however, “…a bad review blows up in your face, not just in the author's.”[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B7) Many problems identified in poorly conducted book reviews can be attributed to the poor evaluative and writing skills of the reviewer.[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8) However, sometimes these problems are rooted in the book reviewer's lack of understanding of portions of the book review process.[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B7) An appreciation of the purpose and significance of all aspects of the book review process can provide the book review author with a wider perspective to employ when crafting a book review.\n\nIn the biomedical literature, there are a number of expert opinion pieces that describe strategies for evaluating books and writing book reviews.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [9–14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9) However, we were unable to find an evidence-based source to assist authors when writing a book review. Thus, we conducted a structured literature search and narrative review of the literature to equip the book reviewer with an evidence-based understanding of all aspects pertaining to the book review process. This article provides an amalgamation of recommendations and a helpful worksheet to use when conducting book reviews.\n\n## Methods\n\nA literature search was conducted in June 2009 using the following databases: MEDLINE (1950– 2009) and EMBASE (1980–2009) through OVID Publishing, CINAHL Plus with Full Text (1937– 2009) through EBSCO Publishing, and the Index to Chiropractic Literature (2000–2009). The search strategy used a combination of controlled vocabulary from the respective databases and truncated text words. All terms from the controlled vocabularies were exploded and searched as major concepts when available. Reference lists of the retrieved studies were scanned to identify any articles that may have been missed from the literature search. A full search strategy is provided in Figure [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/figure/F1/).\n\n[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/figure/F1/)\n\n[![An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is JCE-24-1-57-g001.jpg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/bin/JCE-24-1-57-g001.jpg \"Click on image to zoom\")](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom\u0026p=PMC3\u0026id=2870990_JCE-24-1-57-g001.jpg)\n\nThe search strategies used to obtain articles for this report.\n\nArticles retrieved from the search were screened using abstracts and citations. In instances in which the article topic was unclear, the full text was retrieved. Article screening and selection was conducted by the primary author (ADL). Selection criteria for articles to be included in the review were that they must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported on one or more of the following criteria: strategies for conducting scholarly book reviews, thematic issues related to the publication of scholarly book reviews, or recommendations on academic writing of which a section pertained to writing scholarly book reviews.\n\nArticles that met the inclusion criteria were descriptively analyzed by the primary author (ADL) and the data extracted included: author(s), publication type, and narrative information concerning scholarly book reviews and their publication. To generate recommendations for conducting book reviews, the authors' personal experiences writing book reviews and acting as journal editors were used to supplement the evidence gleaned from the articles included in this review.\n\n## Results\n\nThe initial search yielded 839 citations. After duplicate citations were removed and selection criteria were applied, a total of 76 articles were identified as being relevant for this report. Scanning of reference lists within each article yielded an additional 10 articles. Despite efforts made to contact the sources of eight publications, these articles were irretrievable due to lost holdings from accessed libraries and cessation of journal publication. Therefore, a total of 78 articles[1–78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B1) were included in this review. The articles included were classified into four groups according to their publication formats: 1) narrative commentaries (_n_ = 26),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [4–7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [9–14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [47–61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B47) 2) editorials or journal announcements (_n_ = 25),[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B1), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [15–37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B15) 3) original research (_n_ = 18),[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [62–78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B62) and 4) journal correspondence (_n_ = 9).[38–46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B38)\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Stakeholders and Purpose of the Book Review\n\nThe scholarly book review serves many purposes and is best appreciated by understanding the perspectives of the stakeholders involved. The primary audience for a book review is the journal's readership. Book reviews are an excellent vehicle to inform readers about new books in the marketplace.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B27), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) Books are relatively expensive and scholars have limited time to commit to reading. Thus, journal patrons may rely upon the book review's evaluative purpose to guide their reading preferences.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14) Readers need to be informed of new, innovative, and ground-breaking books while being warned of books of poor quality and those that may not relate to their area of interest.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2) The book review can also increase a reader's scope by introducing books that a reader may not otherwise consider reading.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14)\n\nInterestingly, the authors of the books under review may be the most avid readers of book reviews.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18) Authors have invested much time and effort into writing their books, and it is not surprising that an author would be curious about how other scholars perceive their books. The reviewer has the opportunity to provide the author with the recognition or appreciation they deserve or to provide suggestions for any faults identified in the final product.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B23), [43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B43) Therefore, the book review can play a large role in influencing the development of future editions.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18)\n\nPublishers have a vested interest in book reviews because they are an indirect form of advertising and have the potential to influence book sales.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B23) While this review did not identify a study that has evaluated the effect of book reviews on book sales, publishers continue to send review copies of their books to journal editors with the prospect of obtaining a book review.[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B50) In 1983, Morton[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B64) obtained survey data from 15 publishers. All publishers surveyed believed book reviews had a positive effect on sales to physicians, and each of the publishers in this study distributed review copies to medical journals in the hopes of having a review appear in one or more of the prestigious journals. Publishers may use book reviews to determine if a book is worthy of a future edition, whether changes need to be made for a future edition, and whether the author is worthy of another book contract.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) The contents of a favorable review may be used in promotional materials and book reviews can be used for market research for the planning of future titles.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32)\n\nIt has been suggested that librarians use book reviews in the selection process for acquiring library holdings.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B60), [64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B64), [65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B65), [68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B68), [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B77) Chen[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B68) cited an average time lag of 10.43 months from book release to book review publication, and Morton[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B64) identified publication time lag and inadequate book review indexing as limiting factors for the use of book reviews as selection tools. Book reviews may have an indirect effect on library selection by the recommendations of patrons and faculty for book selection. In 1986, Martin[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B65) surveyed 136 medical acquisition librarians and found that book reviews ranked seventh on a list of 10 selection aids used for book selection by medical librarians and concluded that reviews were often used in conjunction with other selection tools for book selection. Some experts have suggested that book reviews may serve more as aids against which librarians may check their holdings for titles missed or as a means for identifying very important or poor titles.[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B68), [74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B74) Whether book reviews are used to determine library holdings is debatable; however, librarians read them and may serve as book reviewers themselves.[77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B77)\n\nLastly, the book review serves several purposes for the reviewers. Publishing a scholarly book review allows the reviewer to contribute to the professional literature by acting as an entrusted critic with the responsibility of informing the readership of seminal works and warning it of inaccurate scholarship.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61) Publishing book reviews is also an exercise of self-education. Many reviewers welcome the opportunity to stay current by reading a newly released text and enjoy practicing their critical faculties.[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B50) Academic authorities have proposed that writing a book review may be an excellent first publication experience for the novice writer.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B30), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31), [59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B59) For experienced book reviewers, however, it may be their altruistic commitment to scholarship and the honor of being asked to review a book that may motivate them.[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61)\n\n### Book Review Publication Process\n\nThe book review process starts and is driven, to a large extent, by the publisher.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32) When review copies of new books are available, publishers send review copies to the staff of relevant journals in hopes that the book will be reviewed. Due to the overwhelming number of books sent to journals, not all books received are reviewed. Often the selection of books reviewed is made in accordance to a journal's aim, scope, and readership.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57) Once a book is selected for review, the book review editor must match the book with a qualified reviewer.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22)\n\nMost book reviews appearing in print are commissioned—meaning that book reviewers are invited by the book review editor to conduct the review.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B36) Book reviewers are typically not paid for their work, but often get to keep the book once they have completed their review.[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19), [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B25), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B30), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52), [59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B59) Therefore, editors tend to rely on a core group of book reviewers with different areas of expertise who have agreed to act in this capacity. Occasionally, the editor will invite a notable expert in the field to review a book. The ideal book reviewer has been described by Johnson[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10) as someone who has published himself or herself in the field of concern. It is important that the author is familiar and well read on the topic. Being a specialist or an authority in one's field is an asset, but may not be a necessity. A few editorials and narrative commentaries mention that it is often advantageous to have reviews written by nonexperts who represent the intended audience of the book under review.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22) However, if the book is written for a specialist audience, sufficient knowledge is required to properly review the material.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B30)\n\nCommissioned reviews are preferred by most editors because it is easier to ensure consistency with journal policy and safeguard from conflict of interest.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B36) If the majority of reviews are invited, how does one become a reviewer? Occasionally journals will advertise for book reviewers.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B26) The majority of experts on book reviewing recommend that interested potential book reviewers contact the book review editor of a journal to express their interest. This should be followed up by sending a curriculum vitae with a cover letter outlining one's area(s) of expertise and the area(s) in which one would like to serve as a reviewer.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B30) It may be wise to send a portfolio of previously published book reviews and scholarly articles.[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) Unsolicited reviews, while not common, may be accepted by some journals if they are well written.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B36), [55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B55) If one is interested in writing an unsolicited review, most authorities advocate contacting the editor(s) of the journal in question prior to writing a review.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B36)\n\nOnce an invitation has been extended by the journal editor, the reviewer must decide if he or she is an appropriate match for the book in question.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10) Professional ethics require that reviewers decline an invitation if their objectivity is compromised or if they are not qualified to conduct the review.[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9) Reasons for declining the invitation may include instances when the reviewer has a personal relationship with the author,[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2) is being published or is seeking to be published by the same publisher, is not representative of the intended audience, or will be unable to meet the deadline.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) Certain journal editors mention that it is easier to handle an initial refusal than to navigate the ramifications of the aforementioned issues.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B36) If the invitation is declined, it is common courtesy for the invited to suggest another potential reviewer and make arrangements to return the book if it is already in possession.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12)\n\nAccompanying the invitation to conduct the book review is a submission deadline that usually ranges from 1 to a few months.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19) Research on the time lag from book release to the publication of its review highlights the importance of conducting the review in a timely manner.[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B64), [65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B65), [68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B68) Book review editors have suggested that if the review cannot be completed by the deadline, the book should be sent back to the publisher so it can be reviewed promptly by another qualified individual.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12) Conducting a high-quality review within the allotted time frame will ensure subsequent invitations to conduct book reviews.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14)\n\nWhen the completed book review has been submitted, the editor reserves the right to edit or reject the review.[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B24) It should be noted that book reviews are edited but are not customarily peer reviewed.[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B50), [60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B60) Since many journals are not published monthly, it may take up to a year or longer for the review to appear in print.[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) Once published, the journal will sometimes send a copy of the book review to the book publisher.\n\n### Appraising the Book\n\nReading a book for the purposes of generating an informative critique necessitates a planned appraisal strategy. As a first step, the reviewer should research the author's qualifications and previous contributions to the topic area to determine the author's authority.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B13) If it is obvious the author is not sufficiently qualified, it may be appropriate to comment on this in the review. Before reading the book in depth, one should briefly skim the book to orient oneself to the organization, layout, and visual appeal. Note the type of book one is reviewing because different methods may be used to review different works.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12) For example, the strategy for reviewing a new edition of a textbook will require an evaluation of any changes made from previous editions, whereas the assessment of a compilation of conference proceedings may focus on the organization and ease of locating abstracts.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2)\n\nThe majority of articles included in this report highlight the importance of reading the preface and introduction of the book prior to reading its content.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [4−6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B9), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) These sections state the author's intentions, aims, and purpose for writing the book. Most importantly, these two sections will define the intended readership. It is important to judge the book by its aims and objectives and evaluate it from the perspective of the intended readership.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) A key question to ask is whether the contents are appropriate for the readership level.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) Book reviewers can error by judging a book by their own aims and objectives and by criticizing authors for something that was explained in the preface.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B7), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11)\n\nAnother section of a book that warrants a book reviewer's attention is the table of contents. It provides the reviewer with information about the organization of the book, an overview of its contents, and the development of the topics to be discussed.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B2), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12) This section can be used to determine if all relevant topics were included or if any key topics were overlooked.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5)\n\nOnce oriented to the preface, introduction, and table of contents, the reviewer now has a setting and perspective to appraise the book. The book should be read carefully, taking notes while reading, as any praise, arguments, criticisms, or conclusions made in the review should be substantiated.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) The book should be evaluated on a variety of items such as accuracy, completeness, readability, and relevance.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11) A book appraisal worksheet is provided in the appendix (also online at [www.journalchiroed.com](http://www.journalchiroed.com/)) and lists a variety of appraisal items to be evaluated when reading a book for review. It also functions as a notation sheet where a reviewer can make notes on any strengths or weaknesses, write comments, provide examples to support these remarks, and make suggestions for improvement. These notes will form the basis of the critique.\n\nWhile it is important to assess the book on a variety of features, certain key questions should be considered. What makes the book unique?[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61) Is the book useful to the intended readership?[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58) Was the book successful in achieving its aims and objectives?[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B12) How does the book compare to its competitors?[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19) What contribution does the book make to the field?[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B7), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B47), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B58), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61) The answers to these questions will help the reviewer describe the distinguishing features of the book and place it within its field. Considering that a book review is a personal account of a book, it is important to note one's personal reactions to the book.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11)\n\nA recurring question in articles that discussed book appraisal strategies was whether the entire book must be read in order to write the review. All articles that answered this question made reference to the respect that must be given to an author's hard work. It would be disrespectful to the author(s) to write a review without carefully reading the entire book.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19), [48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B48), [49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B49) However, some articles noted exceptions. It may not be practical to read certain books from cover to cover, such as medical dictionaries, encyclopedias, and large multivolume texts.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) In these instances, a method of sampling should be developed and these methods should be reported in the book review.[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52)\n\n### Writing the Book Review\n\nWriting the review can be a challenge because there is a reluctance for journals to provide a prescriptive format for writing book reviews.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18) Book review editors often prefer reviews that are informative, engaging, and constructively opinionated.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11) Therefore, any attempt for a book review to be formatted to a strict preconceived style is “…stunting creativity and literary development.”[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B11) Critics of structured book reviews argue that such reviews are informative but dull.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B23), [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B28) Since each book is unique, reviews should be tailored to the uniqueness of the book under review and the writing style of the reviewer. Variety in book reviews helps maintain the reader's interest.\n\nIt should be noted that certain journals may have specific format requirements; for instance, the inclusion of the book's specifications (eg, author, publisher, ISBN, number of pages, etc.) and word limit. A reviewer should become familiar with the journal's book review policy before writing the review. Although most journals do not provide strict book review writing guidelines, most exhibit an underlying “house style.”[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B29) A perusal of book reviews appearing in the journal will orient the reviewer to the journal's informal house style. Word limits vary between journals and can be as short as 75 words to greater than 2000.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57) Chen's[67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B67) study of 3347 biomedical book reviews found most reviews to be over 265 words. Kroenke[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B62) identified a mean limit of 373 words among 480 medical book reviews and found that tangential information and reviewer opinions on the subject of the book increased the length of reviews. The majority of sources consulted in this review reported word limits ranging from 250 to 500 words with editors' preferences toward shorter reviews.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B20), [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B24), [57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57) Limited word counts necessitate a concise writing style. Methven[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4) recommended combining several ideas into a single sentence to achieve the goal of being succinct. Many book review editors believe the quality of a book review is rarely associated with its length.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22), [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B24), [57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57)\n\nWhile there is no prescriptive style when writing a review, many experts outline a common strategy utilized to convey their critique,[3–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3) which is summarized in Table [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/table/T1/). \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFB8EBA6;\"\u003eThese recommendations are in line with Motta-Roth's[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B79) findings of four main rhetorical moves identified in scholarly book reviews. These four moves are: 1) introduce the book, 2) outline the book, 3) highlight parts of the book, and 4) provide a general evaluation of the book. These four moves were often associated with the start of a new paragraph.[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B79)\u003c/mark\u003e \n\n### Table 1\n\nA recommended strategy for crafting a book review\n\nParagraph of the Review\n\nAction Step\n\nFirst\n\n• Capture the reader's attention.\n\n• Outline the aims and scope.[3–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3)\n\nMain text\n\n• Describe the central ideas of the book.\n\n• Explore key arguments of the review.\n\n• Discuss strengths and weaknesses of the book.\n\n• Highlight the book's uniqueness.\n\n• Note the book's contribution to the field.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4)\n\nFinal\n\n• Balance the book's achievements and weaknesses in order to support the final\n\nassessment.[3–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8)\n\nThe reviewer must now decide which appraisal items to comment on in the review. Kroenke[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B62) surveyed 480 book reviews and found that the mean number of features commented on per review was 9.0 ± 2.7. With most reviews spanning 250 to 500 words, it is not possible to include a critique of all appraisal items evaluated. The reviewer must decide which items are most important to mention to provide a balanced and informative critique. The book appraisal worksheet found in the appendix is designed to assist the reviewer in compiling all appraisal notes into a single, efficient format for ease of identification of items to be included in the review.\n\nDepending on the specific book under review, certain appraisal items may deserve more mention than others. For instance, a student textbook with an index of limited utility is an important finding; however, the same finding in a patient handbook may not deserve mention. Similarly, the importance of image quality differs for a radiology text compared to a medical dictionary. It is important to recognize that appraisal item selection is specific to the book under review. In addition to these book-specific items, many experts suggest that attempts should be made to place a book in a larger, broader context to allow judgment of the book against its competitors and to allow for the determination of the book's contribution to its field.[3–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B19), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61), [62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B62)\n\nA final note regarding book review writing is on how to convey criticism. A book review is an evaluative critique.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4) Readers are interested in the book reviewer's opinions and a reviewer should not be afraid to state opinions.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B4) Any factual mistakes, shortcomings, or weaknesses should be made known.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B6) However, reviewers should be respectful to the authors and write in a professional manner. Book reviewers are not anonymous and the rules of basic courtesy and libel law apply.[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B25), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32) Given that book authors are often readers of book reviews, any unwarranted criticism likely will be read by the book author.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18) Hill[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14) and Boring[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B47) recommend using descriptive comments, and not conclusions, to describe problems identified in books to allow readers to arrive at their own conclusions. Any criticism should be substantiated with examples or a relevant explanation of the reasons for the criticism to avoid confusion about a reviewer's arguments.[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B14), [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B33) Criticism should also be constructive.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B10), [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18), [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B33) The reviewer, where possible, should provide suggestions for improvement, because these suggestions may influence the crafting of a future edition. The book appraisal worksheet found in the appendix is designed to aid the reviewer in developing sound criticism by providing a template to document examples to be used to substantiate criticism and to provide suggestions for improvement to ensure constructive comments. Desirable and undesirable characteristics of book reviews are listed in Figure [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/figure/F2/).\n\n[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/figure/F2/)\n\n[![An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is JCE-24-1-57-g002.jpg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/bin/JCE-24-1-57-g002.jpg \"Click on image to zoom\")](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom\u0026p=PMC3\u0026id=2870990_JCE-24-1-57-g002.jpg)\n\nDesirable and undesirable characteristics of book reviews.\n\n### Issues Relating to Book Reviews\n\nThree issues deserve special attention: conflicts of interest, reviewer bias, and time lag in publication of reviews. One issue that can affect the credibility of a book review is the influence of a conflict of interest, which exists in scholarly publication when an author, reviewer, or editor has financial or personal relationships that inappropriately influence his or her actions.[80](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B80) Conflicts of interest can occur when a book under review is published by the same publisher who publishes the journal that prints the review,[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B63) a book is reviewed by a journal and one of the author(s) or editor(s) of the book is an employee of the journal,[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B63) the reviewer is a personal friend of the author,[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B17) the reviewer is a competing researcher or author,[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B17) or there is financial gain that influences the outcome of the review.[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B17) Avoiding these conflicts when publishing book reviews can be difficult, especially in highly specialized fields of study, when the pool of qualified experts who contribute to scholarly activities is small. In these situations, the likelihood of book reviewers, book authors, publishers, and journal editors having preexisting relationships increases, potentially affecting one's objectivity. When these conflicts of interest exist, transparency and proper disclosure of conflicts of interest are essential.[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B17), [63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B63)\n\nIn addition to conflicts of interest, reviewer bias can influence book reviews. Fairness, accuracy, and objectivity of a review remain a problematic issue in publishing book reviews.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18), [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B20) For instance, book reviewers known to be overly critical may more likely produce negative reviews, enthusiastic reviewers may not scrutinize a literary work properly, and advocates for one opinion in a polarized field of study may not fairly judge a book about competing viewpoints.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18) Reviewer bias has the potential to provide an inaccurate representation of the book in question and may negatively influence a readership's perceived value of the book review process. To increase the objectivity of book reviewers, some authors suggest that journals should encourage printed communication between the reviewer and book author,[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B18) multiple reviews of the same title should be conducted,[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B40) and book reviews should be subjected to peer review. While some journals have implemented the former two suggestions, peer review of book reviews has not been widely accepted.[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B40)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the time lag of book review publication is an important issue affecting book reviews. For most academic works, the first year after publication is the period of greatest sales. On average, a book's use declines most rapidly in the early years following publication.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57), [66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B66) Part of the problem relating to the time lag of book review publication can be attributed to the publishers. Review copies of books are often not available early enough for people to review them in time to coincide with a book's release date. Even if review copies were available, by the time the review is completed, has passed the editing process, and has sat in line for publication, most experts and publishers believe the review would appear in print after the book publication anyway.[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B64)\n\n### Future of Book Reviews\n\nThe future of the book review is uncertain. Recently, a perceived lack of utility of the book review has contributed to a fall in popularity of the literary form. In the past, the book review may have served more purpose in informing librarians and readers of new books. Currently, in the age of the Internet, librarians and readers are targeted more readily by publishers directly.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32) Also, book reviews do not rank high in the hierarchical scale of professional scholarship. Academic institutions often do not give their scholars credit for publishing book reviews.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B23) From a journal's perspective, the book review makes no contribution to the journal's impact factor.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32), [72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B72) There is also an issue of journal space and limited page count. The publication of a few pages of book reviews implies the rejection or delay in publication of an original research paper, which negatively impacts journal content and timeliness to publication.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32) Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the publication of book reviews helps sell books, increase readership of journal contents, or generate subscriptions to journals.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B32)\n\nWhile some authors highlight issues detracting from the popularity of the scholarly book review, reforms have been proposed to contribute to the evolution of this literary form. Book review editors have proposed the exploration of different book review formats: specifically, the rejoinder, multidisciplinary, special issue, and integrated formats.[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16), [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B34), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B61)\n\nRejoinders are reviews where the reviewer and author are given the opportunity to discuss the book and its review in the same journal issue, increasing the objectivity of the reviewer and providing the reader with a more balanced perspective of the book being evaluated.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B52) The multidisciplinary format requires a book be reviewed by multiple reviewers, each coming from a different discipline, allowing a book to be reviewed in a broader disciplinary context.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16) While appearing periodically, the special issue format is used to review books that supplement the central theme of papers in a special journal issue and may allow for better evaluation of a book's contribution to its topic area.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16) The integrated review is a format conducted as an essay commissioned on a specific theme, and imbedded within the essay are reviews of books related to the paper's thesis. By merging book reviews within a treatise of a select topic, reviewers have the opportunity to utilize comparative analysis to extend reader understanding of writings on a topic, while publishing a substantial scholarly paper.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31) Readers of this format have the opportunity to be enlightened by the essay and will appreciate more the book's significance and contribution of each book to the specific theme under discussion.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B16), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31), [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B34), [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B35) While these alternative formats may seem appealing, they must demonstrate their usefulness in the framework of the dilemmas that journal editors face, including limited page space, impact factor, reader interest, and a priority to referee peer review of original manuscripts.\n\nAnother influential factor affecting the future of book reviews is information technology, which will influence how book reviews will be published as well as what is reviewed. There have been calls for book reviews to be published on the Internet to allow for immediacy and ease of discussion.[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22), [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B77) With online publication, competition for print space will lessen and reviews may be able to extend to larger word limits as well as expand to use “new” formats.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B57) Also, journal editors are increasingly receiving various information technology media for review.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31), [44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B44) Book review sections of journals are slowly expanding their sections to include reviews of information technology media such as DVD, video, and websites.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B3), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B22), [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B31), [44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B44)\n\n### Limitations and Research Directives\n\nA limitation of this review is that the majority of literature used to formulate this report was based largely on expert opinion found in narrative commentaries, editorials, and journal correspondence. Original research constituted 23% of the articles included in this review; however, only three of the studies[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B8), [72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B72), [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870990/#B77) were published within the past 5 years.\n\nTo improve the scholarly rigor in the book review literature, future efforts could investigate the validity of using expert opinion as a means for conducting book reviews, and formal studies could assess the impact of book reviews on book sales and journal subscriptions. Readership surveys could be conducted to assess reader interest in new book review formats and publishing venues, and more importantly, examine the impact of review formats on reader usage of information in their professional work. An exploration of these issues will contribute to the development of our understanding of writing and publishing scholarly book reviews.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe scholarly book review serves many purposes and has the potential to be an influential literary form. It can help guide a readership's reading practices, provide authors with constructive feedback, and help publishers plan and develop future books. However, due to the expectations of these same stakeholders, it is a challenging literary form to master. A reviewer must be aware of not just the strategies employed to conduct a review, but should be knowledgeable of the many issues affecting the entire book review process. An appreciation of this literary form in a broader context will allow the altruistic reviewer to publish a review more likely to be perceived as a valuable contribution to the literature.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nThe second author of this article is also the Editor-in-Chief of _The Journal of Chiropractic Education_.

Lessons learnt from the Translocality: (im) Mobility in transnational and urban contexts workshop in Johannesburg\n\nBy Kudzai Vanyoro\n\nThe [African Centre for Migration \u0026 Society](http://www.migration.org.za), a core partner of the [Migrating out of Poverty Research Programme Consortium](http://migratingoutofpoverty.dfid.gov.uk/) hosted a **_Translocality: (im)Mobility in transnational and urban contexts_** workshop from 1 to 2 June 2016, led by Prof Loren Landau , Dr Zaheera Jinnah and ACMS visiting researcher Dr Lothar Smith (Department of Human Geography, Radboud University, Netherlands). On day one Dr Lothar Smith presented **_Translocality: what is it, does it matter, why does it matter now?_** Prof Loren Landau gave the second presentation **_Translocality on the ground: understanding local developments through the concept of archipelago_**, providing a feel of the South African context. This was followed by a group and plenary discussion to end the day. Day two was initiated by Dr Zaheera Jinnah with her presentation **_The changing meaning of remittances along the way: the case of Somali transmigrants_****. This was** followed by Dr Lothar Smith’s **_The ‘magic’ of remittances: a gender and developmental lens to explore their role interpretation_**_,_ and a discussion.\n\nI will reflect on a few things that stood out for me. In migration studies, the concept of translocality is a complicated matter. Its definition is really hard to find. For Peth[[1]](https://vanyoro.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/what-does-translocality-mean-and-why-does-it-matter-lessons-learnt-from-the-translocality-im-mobility-in-transnational-and-urban-contexts-workshop-in-johannesburg/#_ftn1), translocality constitutes a wide range of enduring, open and non-linear processes whose product is close relations between different places and people. As a migrant, I was unaware of the applicability of this concept to my day-to-day experiences. During the workshop, I learnt that through varying ‘relations’ with different spaces and places (two contested terms), migrants produce multiple perceptions of belonging by expediently choosing to (dis) connect with home.\n\n“In transnational migration the migrant might lose sense of who they are”. A conversation with a friend comes back to mind. When asked where I see myself in the next five years, I was tongue-tied in search of a response. Because of my migration to Johannesburg, I find myself faced with challenges of defining home. Is it my rural home in rural Zimbabwe, or my urban family home? Is it my apartment in Johannesburg? But, as Greiner (2010: 131) posits after translocal interactions, “…Many migrants develop identities that combine rural and urban lifestyles”[[2]](https://vanyoro.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/what-does-translocality-mean-and-why-does-it-matter-lessons-learnt-from-the-translocality-im-mobility-in-transnational-and-urban-contexts-workshop-in-johannesburg/#_ftn2) . The concept of translocality allows us to see through possibilities of cosmopolitanism; of being here and there at the same time, ultimately leaving migrants in ‘nowhereville’ (Landau).\n\nAs Landau argued during the two day workshop, migrants may connect or disconnect in the new spaces in which they find themselves in. Not all migrant identities will alter or falter in varying spaces. Equally, the agency of the local people in host communities must not be neglected. The agency of both migrants and locals may positively collide and both parties may find themselves fascinated by the culture that each brings to the table. Such interactions take place is Braamfontein, the area where Wits is located. Many migrants intermingle with locals, who are themselves of different types of ancestral descent. In these interactions, both groups pick positive cultural traits from their experiences with the ‘other’.\n\nLast, the workshop demonstrated how social media networks have translocalised societies in un-imaginable and underexplored fashions. Far from aiding in the communication of remittance transfer to families (a concept Dr. Jinnah dealt with), social media is a society for some.  Dr. Smith underscored that migrants who find themselves ‘in-between’ societies, not belonging to either home or abroad (‘nowhereville’), may resort to virtual society. Surprisingly, little research has been carried out on social media (as a space) and migration, particularly in African migration studies. For example, I exist both in a virtual and geographical location.  I use new media to constantly reconnect on a Whatsapp group called ‘Boys DzeHarare’ (Shona for ‘The Boys from Harare’). This is a group of my old Zimbabwean friends who migrated to South Africa, Botswana, Namibia or Europe. In this space, we discuss each other’s socio-economic lives (like who is making it where, who is married now, which pop culture art is the best at home these days?).\n\nIn sum, the workshop proved invaluable to understanding the different physical and virtual spaces I am linked to. The concept of translocality is a complex yet interesting one. With the emergence of new media, it is no longer simple to define localities as spaces , hence there is a need to pursue further research in this area, while engaging various migrant new media groups such as the one I belong to.\n\nKudzai Vanyoro is a [Migrating out of Poverty](http://migratingoutofpoverty.dfid.gov.uk/)  Research Communications intern based at the University of the Witwatersrand [African Centre for Migration \u0026 Society](http://www.migration.org.za)  in Johannesburg.\n\nFollow me on Twitter [@kudzaivanyoro1](https://twitter.com/kudzaivanyoro1)\n\n**References**\n\n[[1]](https://vanyoro.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/what-does-translocality-mean-and-why-does-it-matter-lessons-learnt-from-the-translocality-im-mobility-in-transnational-and-urban-contexts-workshop-in-johannesburg/#_ftnref1) Peth, A.

Consequently, increasing numbers of social scientists have begun calling the emergent migration process in which people live lives stretched across national borders “transnational” (Georges 1990; Kearney 1991a; Sutton 1992a), but the term is often used loosely and without specificity. Frequently the phenomenon of transnationalism is thought to be the outcome of transformations in the technology of communication and transportation, a product of accessible air travel and telecommunications (Wakeman 1988).

While Wallerstein emphasized exchange as the fundamental relationship between the units of the system (Wallerstein 1979), an approach that sees the world as integrated by a global mode of production seems more insightful in explicating the current international division of labor (Laclau 1977; Portes 1978; Portes and Walton 1981; Sassen 1988). \n\n20 d l Page 19 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n21 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 development of transnationalism is a long-term process of global capitalist penetration. \n\n22 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:47 23 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n24 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 framework must address link between culture and relations of power and domination since we are looking at culture.

The loans and investments were supposed to create, according to donor agencies, development and growth in the “less developed countries.” However, even in their most optimistic projections, development agencies acknowledged that dislocation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate would occur in the early stages of investment (DeWind and McKinney 1986). Disruption of local economies indeed did accompany the most recent wave of intense capital penetration and resulted in an increased pool of available labor as whole families of ten migrated to urban areas. This displaced and underemployed labor could not be easily absorbed by the growing but still relatively small manufacturing sector often dominated by multinationals. The stay of these foreign-capitalized companies has often been short-lived, as firms have moved from country to country in search of even lower labor costs, creating a further displacement of workers. And when workers in locations such as the Caribbean and the \n\n51 d l Page 34 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n52 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:47 it is also these transmigrants who are the first to be kicked out when shit hits the fan. especially if they are identifiable in some way. themselves socially, politically and economically vulnerable, no less in the society they have left than in the one they have joined” (1987:23). Doing better…than they would have done had they stayed at home, they are nevertheless disadvantaged in comparison with members of the indigenous population among whom they live and work, and with whom they are, as newcomers, in unequal competition for jobs and other scarce resources…. As long as they remain identifiable, they will always be in danger. In times of adversity, outsiders make ideal scapegoats. So it is that some of the most explosive popular movements in the contemporary world are directed against minorities which can be identified as ‘immigrant’… And such hostility is usually not just directed at immigrants themselves, but also at their locally born offspring (Ballard 1987:18). Both \n\n53 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n54 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:47 great #wording!

Productive of a new imagery, much of this discourse on transnationalism has remained evocative rather than analytical. By linking our definition of transnationalism to migration and rooting our analysis in social relations, we are engaged in a somewhat different, although connected, effort. Our focus becomes the manner in which migrants, through their life ways and daily practices, reconfigure space so that their lives are lived simultaneously within two or more nation-states. \n\n57 d l Page 36 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n58 d l Page 37 28/10/2021 14:46 must look at migrants as active agents in a process of hegemonic construction. network analysis does not look at hegemonic processes of multiple states. instead it just describes connections. Providing us with a clear statement of the ongoing connectedness of migrant ties to “different places,” the call for network analysis focuses our attention on migrants as actors. These formulations, however, do not look at the implications of these networks for the formation of migrant political and social identity, or the complexities of nationalist identifications within transnational social fields. The “spider-web” networks of transmigrants must be located within the hegemonic processes of multiple nation-states, and we must move beyond descriptions of networks to a view of migrants as active agents in a process of hegemonic construction. \n\n59 d l Page 37 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n60 d l Page 38 28/10/2021 14:47 although deteritorialization is being talked about, Basch and Glick Schiller believe that world is divided politically into nation-states that are unequal in their power. Noting the constant penetration of borders, Kearney suggests that we have entered the age of transnationalism, a post-national age in which “members of transnational communities…escape the power of the nation-state to inform their sense of collective identity” (1991a:59). In contrast, we think that the current period, in which the construct of the deterritorialized nation-state is being forcefully articulated, can best be conceived as the moment of a new nationalism. While transmigrants cannot be contained or restrained by national boundaries, the world is still very much divided politically into nation-states that are unequal in their power and that serve differentially as base areas of international capital. \n\n61 d l Page 38 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n62 d l Page 41 28/10/2021 14:47 appadurai speaking about an unboundedness Appadurai, for example, has argued that there is a need to reconceptualize the “landscapes of group identity,” a need that flows from the current world conjuncture in which “groups are no longer tightly territorialized, spatially bounded, historically unselfconscious, or culturally homogeneous” (1991:191). \n\n63 d l Page 41 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n64 d l Page 42 28/10/2021 14:46 we must have a global perspecitive on history and challenge the old ideas and bounded visions of culture and society. A global perspective on history, as well as the contingencies of the current historical conjuncture, challenge us to move beyond bounded visions of culture and society. However, we are often confined by our analytical tool kit of concepts like nation, ethnic group, and tribe that divide the world into autonomous, geographically rooted, and culturally distinct units (Van Binsbergen 1981). These units have been treated as bounded entities, endowed with given, “natural,” and “group-specific” properties. \n\n65 d l Page 42 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n66 d l Page 44 28/10/2021 14:47 Part of the task of this book is to understand the manner in which the conceptual categories of race, ethnicity. and nation are hegemonic constructions and are all part of the historical exercise of state power and domination.

Part of nation building is nationalism, the politicized language or ideology of national unity used by those participating in projects of identity construction that focus on the nation. Nationalism is an ideology of identity; part of the ideology is the belief that national identity is fundamental and natural. \n\n71 d l Page 46 28/10/2021 14:47',title:"1994.Basch, Glick Schiller-Nations Unbound"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2004.kohPersistentAmbiguitiesVietnamese2004":{content:"---\n [[koh]]",title:"2004.kohPersistentAmbiguitiesVietnamese2004"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2005.brubaker-Diaspora-Diaspora":{content:"# Extracted Annotations (2021-12-14)\n\n### p2\n\n\u003e \"proposes to treat diaspora not as a bounded entity but as an idiom, stance and claim.\"([Brubaker 2005:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2))\n\n diaspora as NOT a bounded identity but as an idiom, stance, and claim ([note on p.2) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"Palestinian diaspora, too, has been construed as a 'catastrophic' diaspora/ or in Cohen's (1997) term, a 'victim diaspora'/ on the model of the Jewish case.\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2)Brubaker 2005:3)\n\n [[cohen]]’s term of [[victim diaspora]] ([note on p.3) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"Some emigrant groups/ characterized as 'long-distance nationalists' by Anderson (1998)/ have been construed as diasporas because of their continued involvement in homeland politics, sometimes involving the support of terrorist or ultra-nationalist movements (Sheffer 1986, 2003; Angoustures and Pascal 1996; Bhatt and Mukta 2000).\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)Brubaker 2005:3)\n\n [[long-distance nationalists]] by [[anderson]] are ‘construed as diasporas’ for their involvement in homeland politics ([note on p.3) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"In a further extension, the term has come to embrace labour migrants who maintain (to some degree) emotional and social ties with a homeland.

In an oft-quoted remark by Stuart Hall, the 'diaspora experience... is defined, not by essence or purity, but by the recognition of a necessary heterogeneity and diversity; by a conception of 'identity' which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by hybridity ' (Hall 1990, p. 235, italics original). This counter-current is especially characteristic of the literature on transnationalism, which has tended to fuse in recent years with the literature on diaspora. There is thus a tension in the literature between boundary-maintenance and boundary-erosion .\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)Brubaker 2005:7)\n\n [[005.Authors/hall]] on diaspora experience and identity as diverse and #hybridity \n\ntension between boundary-making and boundary-erosion ([note on p.7) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)\n\n### p8\n\n\u003e\"A final point about the boundary-maintenance criterion is that it must occur over an extended time. This is seldom made explicit, but it is crucial. The erosion of boundaries through assimilation is always a temporally extended, inter-generational process (Alba and Nee 1997, 2003; Brubaker 2001). As a result, boundary maintenance only becomes sociologically interesting, as it were, when it persists over generations. That migrants themselves maintain boundaries is only to be expected; the interesting question, and the question relevant to the existence of a diaspora, is to what extent and in what forms boundaries are maintained by second, third and subsequent generations.\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)Brubaker 2005:8)\n\n boundary-making must occur over an extended time. 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent gens.

Such a definition is so broad that it can refer to the possession of material objects, the display of tastes and dispositions, or formal credentials from institutions. The original formulation—from Bourdieu—defined cultural capital as "goods" transmitted to individual children through family practices that were more or less valued depending on how closely they matched the cultural practices deemed important by institutions like schools (see Bourdieu and Passeron 1977:30). Subsequent reworkings by Bourdieu expanded the concept to include generalized understandings of valued forms of knowledge about cultural goods and symbols. This later definition specified cultural capital as a process or "an act of deciphering, decoding, which presupposes practical or explicit mastery of a cipher or code" (Bourdieu 1984:2). Cultural capital can thus refer to innumerable practices, for example, "table manners or the art of conversation, musical culture or the sense of propriety, playing tennis or pronunciation" (Bourdieu 1984:70), but practices can be identified as cultural capital only in their relationship to other practices that are more or less valued in a specific context.1 The implication is that the logic of valuation—what makes a particular practice valuable in relation to other practices—is not universal and is, in fact, largely arbitrary."([Besbris.Khan 2017:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DGFXZBI?page=3))\n\n definition by [[bourdieu]] as “goods” transferred to children through family practices that were more or less valued depending on how much they were deemed important by institutions.

Imagine, for a moment, that two people know the exact same amount about baseball as one another. They similarly "embody" their baseball knowledge, wearing hats of their favorite team, participating in fantasy leagues with similar enthusiasm, and making pilgrimages to classic ballparks. They use their association with baseball to draw boundaries that are important to them and to gain power and status in their lives in the same ways. Given the money analogy, their cultural association with baseball should produce similar effects on their overall life chances. But imagine that one of these people is a man and the other is a woman.

Instead, Stuart Hall (2008: 346) speaks of ‘cosmopolitanism from below’: There is a ‘cosmopolitanism of the above’ – global entrepreneurs following the pathways of global corporate power and the circuits of global investment and capital, who can’t tell which airport they’re in, because they all look the same, and who have apartments in three continents. This is global [[008.Theory/cosmopolitanism]] of a very limited kind but it is very different from ‘cosmopolitanism from below’ – people driven across borders, obliged to uproot themselves from home, place and family, living in transit camps or climbing on to the backs of lorries or leaky boats or the bottom of trains and airplanes, to get to somewhere else. Both of them are forms of globalization and, in so far as they both interact within the same global sphere, are deeply interconnected with one another.

Hence he launches into a trenchant critique against diasporic intellectuals who speak ‘in the name of mixture and hybridity, a claim to a humanity so fused in its cultural characteristics that no “ethnic absolutism” is possible’ (Friedman 1997: 75–6). The celebration of hybridity, in-betweenness or double consciousness by diasporic poets, artists and intellectu- als proves to be a self-interested strategy, divorced from working-class migrants’ (or indigenous people’s) predicaments and concerns. For the urban poor, he claims, ‘class identity, local ghetto identity, tend to prevail’, leaving ‘little room for the hybrid identifications discussed and pleaded for by cultural elites’ (Friedman 1997: 84). Cultural self-identifications are, ultimately, Friedman argues, like those of class or gender, a matter of social position (Friedman 1997: 88).

Members of ‘victim diasporas’ (created by the forced migration of persecuted peoples) tend to have higher levels of diasporicity because they share powerful historical memories of collective persecution, suffering and traumatic dispersal, which can remain a part of their group conscious- ness for generations and lead to collective solidarity and even mobilization across borders, such as to establish or support a beleaguered homeland or defend against continued ethnic or religious persecution.

When displaced ethnic commu- nities face considerable socio-economic and ethnic exclusion or persecution, they may become more diasporic by relying more on their transnational ethnic linkages with the homeland and to others in the diaspora as a means to obtain resources, social status and belonging denied them in the host society. In fact, a number of scholars have emphasized how diasporic peoples tend not to be assimilated and socially integrated in the host society and face social marginalization and discrimination (Brubaker 2005: 6; Cohen 1997: 186; Parreñas and Siu 2007: 13; Safran 1991: 83; Shuval 2000: 44). In contrast, other dispersed ethnic groups have become cultural and socially assimilated to their host countries over time, which can lead to an attenuation of their trans- national, diasporic connections to homelands and co-ethnic communities abroad. However, a growing number of studies have also documented how the assimilation of immigrants and their descendants is not necessarily incompatible with their continued transnational involvement in countries \n\n27 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n28 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:47 \u003cmark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"\u003ehowever, assimilation of 1st generation does not mean that 2nd generation will not have continued transnational ties with countries of ethnic origin. \u003c/mark\u003e incompatible with their continued transnational involvement in countries of ethnic origin (see Tsuda 2012b for a discussion). \n\n29 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n30 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n31 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n32 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:46 diasporicity of japanese is relatively low due to being a relatively older diaspora and being more assimilated with each other. lateral ethnic affiliations are also weak. Despite their migratory dispersal from the Japanese homeland to predominantly one part of the world, diasporic nikkei communities in the Americas have a relatively low level of diasporicity for a number of reasons. Because they are an older diaspora, their centripetal transnational ties to Japan have generally weakened over time, and they have also not devel- oped notable lateral ethnic connections and affiliations with each other (Tsuda 2016: 261–8; White 2003: 316). Unlike newer, first-generation diasporas, these dispersed populations of Japanese-descent nikkeijin are generations old and have assimilated to their respective host societies, which has led to the attenuation of both their homeland diasporicity and their transnational ethnic connections to Japanese descent communities elsewhere in the Americas. \n\n33 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n34 d l Page 213 28/10/2021 14:47 \u003cmark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"\u003ewestern countries positioned high in geopolitical power have less interest in countries below them. thus, japanese americans less interested in brazilian japanese. in contrast japanese brazilians are much more aware of japanese americans because they see the US as a powerful country in the americas and has impact on the region. \u003c/mark\u003e In addition to their low homeland diasporicity, Japanese Americans do not have any notable lateral transnational ties with Japanese descendants in other countries and have little awareness of them, especially those living in South America (see Tsuda 2016: chapter 8). Because the host country of the Japanese Americans is positioned at the top of the global geopolitical and economic order, they seem to have less interest in Japanese Brazilians and other South American nikkei, who are positioned lower in the diaspora (just as Americans in general have less interest and knowledge about South America because of its lower significance for them). In contrast, Japanese Brazilians are much more aware of Japanese Americans because they (like other Brazilians) focus their attention on the United States, which is the most powerful country in the Americas and has a significant impact on the entire region. \n\n35 d l Page 213 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n36 d l Page 214 28/10/2021 14:47 diasporicity can be used to examine internal differences in a diaspora based on nationality, gender, or immigrant generation. The concept of diasporicity can therefore be used to compare different diasporic groups as well as examine internal differences in a diaspora based on nationality, gender or immi- grant generation. There are undoubtedly many reasons why certain diasporic peoples have stronger transnational connections and communities than others, which are related to the causes of their diasporic dispersal, their level of cultural similarity, their marginalization and discrimination from host societies, and the amount of time they have been living in the diaspora. In this way, diasporicity provides a framework for researchers to empirically assess, compare and explain the characteristics of transnational ethnic groups constituted by migratory dispersal. \n\n37 d l Page 214 28/10/2021 14:46 38 d l Page 294',title:"2019.Tsuda-Diasporacity"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2019.erel-Migrant-Capitals-Proposing":{content:'# Extracted Annotations (2021-12-14)\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "Migrants routinely experience a mismatch between the spatial contexts where their resources were formed and the new contexts where they look to validate these as capitals."([Erel.Ryan 2019:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D68D6QSX?page=3))\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "Combining the macro-level factors of economic and political structures, the meso-level of networks with the micro-level of personal narratives, the article proposes that such a multi-level analytic framework, that is sensitive to temporal and spatial dynamics, is useful in highlighting the fractures, hierarchies and exclusions in specific fields."([Erel.Ryan 2019:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D68D6QSX?page=3))\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "We propose that such a spatio-temporal multi-level analysis can also highlight migrants\' agency and strategies to mobilize resources as capitals; building new capitals in new places.

But diaspora capital sent from abroad ­– from those who left the country as refugees and migrants after the end of the war in 1975 – has also contributed significantly to the country’s economic growth over the past 30 years.\n\nInternational remittances to Vietnam are estimated at US$15 billion annually, making it one of the top 10 destinations in the world for money sent back by diaspora populations. About 7 to 8 per cent of households in Vietnam receive remittances from abroad. In fact, international remittance flows are higher than overseas development assistance, of which Vietnam is also a top 10 recipient.\n\n![Many Vietnamese left the country as refugees and migrants after the end of the war in 1975.

Photo: AFP\n\nOver the years, remittances from the diaspora have taken on different forms. In the 1980s, they largely came in the form of material goods sent from abroad that could be exchanged on the black market in an embargoed, socialist command economy starkly characterised by scarcity. Since the mid-1990s, there has increasingly been a shift to more formal transfer channels such as banks, Western Union and MoneyGram – though informal channels, including honour-based hawala-style transfers and courier services, continue to exist.\n\nHowever, other categories of financial returns from the diaspora have also grown. These include collective remittances in the form of charitable, religious, or humanitarian development donations. In addition, the significant investment remittances from Vietnamese returning to start businesses were an important catalyst to early economic growth. Finally, there are “social remittances”, also known as “grey matter”, which are the ideas and knowledge that the diaspora bring home with them from elsewhere.\n\n### [\n\nVietnamese-American dissidents pen ode to Hong Kong protesters\n\n11 Jul 2019\n\n![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/237x147/public/d8/images/methode/2019/07/11/fc41a3bc-a30a-11e9-9a3c-98259c87fba2_image_hires_172143.jpg?itok=g0NX53am\u0026v=1562836924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3018071/ode-hong-kongs-extradition-bill-protesters-penned-vietnamese?module=hard_link\u0026pgtype=article)\n\nThese days, there are increasing numbers of _Viet Kieu_ – an informal term for overseas Vietnamese – returning to the country to work, live and retire – more than half a million each year, according to government estimates. There are also shorter-term diaspora returns, especially during Tet – the [Lunar New Year –](https://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year?module=inline\u0026pgtype=article) which are almost always accompanied by sums of money and other gifts with multiplier effects.\n\nThese returns have been actively and symbolically encouraged by the Vietnamese government, notably since 2004 when Politburo Resolution 36 was passed affirming overseas Vietnamese as an “integral part of the nation”, followed by the amended Vietnamese Nationality Law of 2008 allowing overseas Vietnamese to hold dual citizenship.\n\n**GOING MOBILE**\n\nNew technologies – both simple and complex – and the increased inclusion of Vietnamese in the formal financial sector are also shaping remittance transfers to Vietnam. The expanding availability of ATMs, for example, opens up the possibility of linked bank accounts to transfer money, although the percentage of the population with formal bank accounts is still comparatively low, next to most countries in the region. There is also significant global attention these days on [mobile phone technologies](https://www.scmp.com/topics/mobile-payments?module=inline\u0026pgtype=article) that would allow those without a bank account to use their phone to store and remit money, potentially increasing financial access for the poor and lowering transaction costs.\n\nEvery Saturday\n\nSCMP Global Impact Newsletter\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Photo: Reuters\n\nSome start-ups like Momo have even moved from airtime credit transfer to providing mobile wallet and e-payment services, while the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies, in partnership with MasterCard and the Asia Foundation, recently ran a feasibility study and pilot project on mobile banking.\n\nThe range of mobile payment options for games, bills, transport and the like is rapidly expanding. Unlike in countries such as Kenya or [the Philippines](https://www.scmp.com/topics/philippines?module=inline\u0026pgtype=article), however, there is not yet a way to cash out mobile credit in Vietnam without a bank account – if there were it would open up an entirely new domestic remittance channel. But mobile money services need regulatory approval and cooperation between banks and telecommunications operators, a constellation of services that has not yet emerged in Vietnam.\n\n**SPENDING AND CONSUMPTION**\n\nRemittances to Vietnam from its diaspora are commonly used to pay for health care, housing and education and to support charitable, humanitarian and religious causes. The funds are also used for business investments and to gain skills associated with overseas migration strategies, such as English-language study and training to become a nail technician – a common low-cost form of entrepreneurship among new Vietnamese immigrants to the US – but also for [gambling](https://www.scmp.com/topics/luxury-gaming?module=inline\u0026pgtype=article). Notably, according to my interviewees, remittances are consistently used to purchase smartphones and motorcycles – items valued for both their utility and as status symbols. Manufacturers of these two consumer goods have actively cultivated interest in and credit for new niche brands and models – driving heightened purchase and behavioural patterns, and creating two of the fastest-growing consumer loan categories in the country.\n\n![Motorcycles are valued for both their utility and as status symbols.

Photo: EPA\n\nFor many, remittances conjure up the power of money and its possibilities for social transformation, as seen by the lives of the Vietnamese community in the [United States](https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states?module=inline\u0026pgtype=article), which is home to the largest proportion of the diaspora. The cold war role of the US in Vietnam is often associated with capitalism – an economic system previously experienced in South Vietnam, before being abruptly denied to the populace after 1975 and only reintroduced in the 1990s, albeit in a form that is often critiqued as “crony”.\n\nIn contemporary Vietnam, a belief in the unfettered nature of “real” American capitalism – where money begets money – abounds. For many remittance receivers, the money that overseas Vietnamese send only affirms their belief of how money works in an ideal capitalist environment.\n\nNot only do overseas Vietnamese send money, but when they return they appear bodily transformed through the fashions and lifestyles such money affords. In Vietnam, many remittance recipients complain that money is not accumulative in the way it is imagined to be in America. They say that money is easily spent, but harder to invest and grow. This is experienced in the difficulty of expanding one’s business beyond a small local enterprise without the right connections in Vietnam’s political establishment, or without access to further lines of credit.\n\n**REMITTANCE DREAMS**\n\nWhen I asked one remittance recipient why she wanted to migrate to America, she explained: “I want to go so I can send money to Vietnam!” Recipients’ frustrations at being “stuck” in Vietnam, and experiencing limited market-entry opportunities without the necessary political connections, have led many to perceive the remittance relationship as perpetuating hierarchies that can only be overcome through overseas migration. In this sense, Vietnam’s diaspora has, over the years, been remitting money and gifts, but also desires – many of which remain unfulfilled.\n\nAspirations for resettlement in America face further challenges as the current US political environment has been discouraging of immigration, extending even to deportations of former Vietnamese refugees. In the meantime, domestic economic opportunities – especially in Vietnam’s urban areas – continue to grow, as do expanding opportunities to travel to other nodes of global and regional labour migration. This may eventually reorient Vietnamese migratory thoughts away from the US as a locus of diaspora resettlement and capitalist accumulation. ■\n\n**Ivan V.

Nozina and Kraus\' backgrounds, both as researchers and within the police force, offers readers an intimate insider perspective into the Vietnamese diasporic experience and its connection to crime networks. By drawing on their previous studies in the Czech language, this book presents an analysis available to an English-speaking audience. The authors make evident that Vietnamese organized crime does not exist independently of itself. Problems, such as "poorly managed migration policies", on all sides of the border--in the CR as well as Vietnam and the international community--are responsible for pushing migrants into "socially ostracising, economically over-exploiting or politically excluding" illegal activites (p. 12). While the focus is the CR, the intention of the authors was to "understand the phenomenon of Vietnamese crime in a wider international context (p. 3)."\n		- \n	- 1 para overview chapter (dan)\n		- The monograph is replete with examples of the legal and illegal dealings of “respectable men” and the bộ đội (mercenaries) who often assist them. It begins with an introduction briefing readers to the details of Vietnamese migration to the CR, their research methodology, criminal networks and their "modi operandi". Qualitative data for the ethnographic study was based on police reports, interviews with police forces and foreign services, and members of the Vietnamese diaspora in the CR and Vietnam. Nozina and Kraus employ the theory of "village mentality" (Chapter 2) to frame and analyze their findings. They argue that "a traditional Vietnamese considers himself not as an independent individual but as a component within a system of relationships", in essence, part of a collective society where the diaspora and criminal networks exist in a partially mutual, yet exploitative symbiosis (p. 7). The main parts of the case study begin on chapter 3 with Vietnamese migration to the Czech republic in the 1950s and increasing with the 1989 Velvet Revolution. The social, economic, and political changes following the Velvet Revolution also saw an increase in organized crime within the diaspora. \n		- Chapter 4 expands on the legal and illegal components of the Vietnamese diaspora and the locations where they merge. The illegal components are organized by size: small, middle, to large organizations. While the 2008 global financial crisis had adverse effects on both old and new migrants, newer migrant workers who lost their jobs were more susceptible to being siphoned into illegal work. This was due in part to the overwhelming amount of debt new migrants accumulated from various dich vu (broker agencies) which supported their transit to Europe.  \n		- Beginning on Chapter5 "models", or non-fictional illustrative examples, are used to show how criminal activity would be executed in various situations. The illegal activities detailed are mainly economic in nature and due to the ubiquitous quality of criminal activities in the CR, Vietnamese migrants and organizations are presented as engaging in some kind of illegal or semi-illegal activity.  Street peddlers, fruit and vegetable sellers, restaurant owners, migration brokers, and apartment owners/renters could all be fronts for an illegal operation. Illegal activities described were extensive and took the form of: tax evasion, counterfeiting tobacco, alcohol, brand goods, and legal and identification documents, drug smuggling and production of illegal substances such as cannabis, meth, or legal precursor drugs, usury, violent crime, and human trafficking, wildlife smuggling, and pseudo hunts. \n		- For example, how under-reported counterfeit merchandise would be imported in containers into Prague using counterfeit documents which were forged under a name of a person that did not exist.  \n	- 1 para per critique \n	- 1 wrap-up (dan)\n \n- what is its contribution to english-only audiences?

The reasons lie in the economic situation of Vietnam, the efforts of many ordinary Vietnamese to improve their lives and ensure a better future for their children, the Vietnamese government\'s policy of support of economic migration abroad, and the dubious activities of numerous broker agencies profiting from the migration. During the 1980s, as a result of the three wars in Indochina, an inefficient state-planned economy, and the bad politico-economic situation in the Communist Eastern Bloc, the Vietnamese economy stood over its own perdition. Due to the ill-realised land and financial reforms, people from many Vietnamese provinces faced starvation or great economic difficulties (The Economist 2002; Crosette 1988). The GDP per capita did not reach US$200 (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 83), the annual rate of inflation soared to over 700% and the value of Vietnamese exports did not constitute even half of the total value of the country\'s imports, which barely reached US$1221 million. Due to military expenditures, the budget resources were almost depleted, government revenues were low and the fiscal deficit was large and persistent (Arkadie and Mallon 2003: 67). As a result of the bad economic situation, wide-scale reforms (đổi mới) were launched at Hanoi\'s Sixth Communist Party Congress in December 1986.

Street dealers of goods, waiters in Vietnamese or Chinese restaurants, and workers in legal/illegal manufacturing workshops are the most typical of those at the bottom of the Vietnamese immigrant hierarchy.

Unfortunately, another disruption in the slowly settling security situation came with the 2008 financial and economic crisis. Just two years before the crisis, the Czech job market was opened up to the Vietnamese labour force, and some 20,000 Vietnamese migrant workers appeared in the CR. Almost all of them lost their jobs after the 2008 financial, and consequent economic, crisis. The economic situation within the diaspora was also downgraded because of the economic crisis. Those at the economic margins of the diaspora, such as the migrant workers and the newcomers, frequently opted for "an alternative way of economic survival" in this situation. As a consequence of their desperate economic situation, they joined the illegal part of the diaspora and were engaged in the production of illegal cigarettes and alcohol, the growing of cannabis, violent crimes such as racketeering and various forms of intimidation and so forth.

The word “return” denotes “to go or come back, as to a former place, position, or state” and therefore does not adequately signify the specificities of the migration trajectory as taken by later-generation diaspora Koreans, who have neither left nor lived in their ancestral homeland and whose understanding of and attachment to Korea has therefore been produced primarily through transgenerational sharing of images and narratives.\n- [tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic2019](tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic2019)\n- [2017.

It reflects the migrants’ own interpretation of their roots, the celebration of cultural heritage, attachment to a sentimentalised place and the importance of ‘knowing where you come from’ for the construction of self-identity (Basu 2007).\n\n[diaspora](diaspora)\n- Parennas and Siu (2009: 7) have argued that diasporic consciousness and identifica- tion ‘emerge and grow stronger from local processes of racialisation’. ﻿Parennas, R. and L.

This can be evident through the stories they shared.\n	- Tsuda speaks of Japanese diaspora having weaker diasporicity since they are an older diaspora. Contrast with the Vietnamese diaspora which is a relatively newer one (beginning around 1975 with the liberation of VN).\n	- Lateral transnational ties with Coethnics\n	- Because the western countries 2nd generations lived in are positioned high in terms of geopolitical power, lateral connections between Coethnics are more prevalent.\n	- Although viets are part of the “model minority” myth, SE Asians face economic, political, and social hurdles unlike Japanese older diasporas.\n- Stuart Hall (2008: 346) speaks of ‘cosmopolitanism from below’. ﻿There is a ‘cosmopolitanism of the above’ – global entrepreneurs following the pathways of global corporate power and the circuits of global investment and capital, who can’t tell which airport they’re in, because they all look the same, and who have apartments in three continents. This is global cosmopolitanism of a very limited kind but it is very different from ‘cosmopolitanism from below’ – people driven across borders, obliged to uproot themselves from home, place and family, living in transit camps or climbing on to the backs of lorries or leaky boats or the bottom of trains and airplanes, to get to somewhere else. Both of them are forms of globalization and, in so far as they both interact within the same global sphere, are deeply interconnected with one another. But they don’t constitute the basis of a ‘global citizenship’.\n\n- Jonathan Friedman (1995: 79–80) addresses issues of transnational subjectivity as manifestations of new class formations. The “global elites”.\n- Within any single national, regional or territorial community, however, these global networks disrupt, as Homi K. Bhabha (1994) has argued, any neat notions of national boundedness, without denying them. In Location of Culture.\n- Migration is a class-related phenomenon, and notions of transnationalism or cosmopolitanism as cultural phenomena are of necessity class related (see Novikowski 1984; Werbner 1990).

The one thing that they have in common is that all of them have Vietnamese roots, but they were born or raised in Western countries[[1]](#_ftn1). In their 20s or 30s, they decide to experience living in Vietnam. \n\nThis study tries to answer what factors shape the return of Vietnamese heritage westerners back to Vietnam and explores their experiences in regards to the integration into Vietnamese society. Although it is early to form the final conclusions, the preliminary analysis suggests many possible factors shape the return of Vietnamese westerners. Maybe, it is possible to classify them into three types of factors: individual (personal), social (interactional), and external (environmental). \n\nIndividual factors can be “a quest for identity”, social can be “a Viet Kieu/expat community in Vietnam” and external can be “globalization/modernization/technology (ICT)”. However, there are yet fifteen more interviews to code, as well as to process the already developed codes and merge them into categories and themes. \n\nThe respondents faced many identity issues while growing up (among other things, because they looked different than the majority or because of conflict between fitting into Western cultural heritage and being raised with Vietnamese cultural values). They sometimes experienced racism, discrimination, and bullying. They had to put extra effort to fit in and become accepted as a regular part of a community. What is interesting is that when respondents came to Vietnam, they again experienced similar issues as in their countries of birth. They were seen as Westerners or foreigners, they looked different, they could not fit in with Vietnamese traditional cultural values, and overall, they could not connect with the mindset of local Vietnamese. In my opinion, this is the most interesting aspect of this research, and deconstructing it can benefit with some very interesting findings. It is interesting to focus on how Vietnamese heritage westerners who moved to Vietnam react to this, and how it helps them to reconsider, rebuild, or accept their identity. \n\nThe other interesting aspect of the study is that it shows that Vietnamese westerners who moved to Vietnam usually stay in social circles that include other Viet Kieu's (or other foreign ex-pats). This can also be connected with identity, as although Vietnamese westerners come from many different countries, they still have a lot in common. First of all, the same Vietnamese heritage, identity issues that are characteristic for the second generation of Vietnamese westerners (feeling half, feeling split, being in the middle, balancing identities) and other struggles (racism/discrimination, language issues, family issues, etc.) they had while growing up are similar for all of them. The identity of the second-generation Vietnamese seems to be very different from the identity of first-generation Vietnamese who immigrated to Western countries, the major population of their birth country, as well as of Vietnamese who never left Vietnam. This places Viet Kieu identity as a distinct category of (inter)national identities. This can be brought in the connection with newly emerging identities that are being formed in our (post)modern society that is characterized by the global movement of capital, people, and symbols. It would be good to explore this Viet Kieu identity even further and to understand how it differs from traditional (national) identities. \n\nIt is also important to put some focus on the effects of globalization, modernization, and technological advancements (which is also connected with the Viet Kieu / ex-pat community in Vietnam). For example, it can be argued that the second generation of Vietnamese westerners comes to Vietnam because of its modernization and job opportunities. The respondents are usually highly educated and came to Vietnam to work for international companies. This allowed them to explore their roots, reconnect with family they have in Vietnam, travel, while they could also get international work experience and improve their careers. They realize that Vietnam is changing and they come there to be a part of Vietnam’s growth. For example, they promote businesses, try to improve the education system, and help certain groups such as underprivileged girls. They are also “rebranding” Vietnam through posting audio-visual content on social networks and internet, showing to the world that Vietnam changed and in that way, attracting other Vietnamese who were born in western countries to come to Vietnam, as well as tourists and expats. \n\nICTs also play a big role in making the life of Vietnamese returnees easier. First of all, they allow them to stay in touch (through instant chats, video calls, and other means of internet communication) with their parents and friends who stayed in their birth countries. Additionally, ICTs help them to connect with people of similar interests and build new social networks in Vietnam. For example, there are many Viet Kieu groups where returnees can find different types of information that can make their first weeks/months in Vietnam easier. Also, they use online groups and networks to connect with people of similar interests, to find events they can attend, and to build new social networks. It might be argued that ICTs allow returnees to live in Vietnam without fully integrating. Through the internet and ICTs, they can easily stay in the Viet Kieu/Expat social bubble, shop or order food online, and generally stay disconnected from the local Vietnamese society while still being a part of it. \n\nIn conclusion, this study can provide some interesting observations on how identities are formed in the contemporary world. It shows how identity can be deconstructed, reconsidered, reinvented, and accepted. It shows how traditional notions of identity that are based on ethnicity or nationality transform into other types of identities that are more global, international, or hybrid. On a micro-scale, this is a story about the second-generation of Vietnamese westerners, about their personal and social struggles, as well as about approaches for overcoming them. Finally, it is also a story about Vietnam going through a change. Vietnamese westerners, although not fully integrated into Vietnamese society, and often in disjunction with traditional Vietnamese cultural values, represent the new drive of Vietnam’s modernization and their return to Vietnam will probably have important effects on the further economic and cultural transformation of Vietnam.",title:"010.Preliminary Qualitative Data Analysis"},"/010.Qualitative-Data/020.coding-notes":{content:'ATLAS.ti 9 project bundle, networks of potential categories, grounded theory methodology paper, and preliminary analysis writing.  \nIn Atlas.ti file, there are 753 codes divided by 5 major code groups: \n\n1.

How do we minimize the friction of taking notes in a PDF document and turning those into evergreen, permanent notes?\n\nThose were the exact questions I was asking myself a few days ago. Reading research papers was a mess. I had no good way to import my highlighted notes to my note system, and the only good way didn't do everything I needed it to.\n\nSo I created my own system for reading research papers; a combination of [Zotero](https://zotero.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Let me show you what I made, and how it can help you.\n\n**Process outline**\n\n1.  Add paper to Zotero inbox\n2.  Read the paper when I have time — and take notes\n3.  Automatically ingest it into Obsidian with the desired template and metadata\n4.  Processing the notes; creating literature notes, and turning those into permanent notes\n\nIn this article, I'll show you 1-3. Later, I'll show you how I process what I've read, turning them into literature notes, and finally, permanent notes.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\n## Setting up Zotero\n\nThe process always starts with me adding a paper to my Zotero inbox. [Learn how to maintain your Inbox and keep it clutter-free.](https://bagerbach.com/blog/how-i-process-inputs-from-the-internet/)\n\nI use the [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) extension to save papers directly to Zotero from my browser. You can also use the magic wand button in Zotero to add papers by their DOI.\n\nI use the new built-in PDF reader for Zotero, which allows me to extract annotations in a certain way. If you don't use it, you can use [Zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile) to extract annotations directly from the PDF, and they will still be inserted into the note.\n\nTo summarize; if you take notes with Zotero, extract the annotations through the right-click menu, and they'll be inserted into the note we're creating later. If you are taking notes directly in your PDF, you should use Zotfile to extract the annotations - and these will also be included when you create a new note. You can extract annotations with Zotfile by right-clicking the PDF in Zotero, clicking `Manage Attachments`, and then `Extract Annotations`.\n\n## Setting up Obsidian\n\nTo enable the workflow on Obsidian, you'll need the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin. Check out my video [here](https://youtu.be/gYK3VDQsZJo) for how it works. You will also need the [Citations](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) plugin. To set up Citations, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin#setup).\n\nNow, let's set up the template.\n\n### My research paper template\n\nThe following is the template I use for papers. I use [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), so my metadata looks a bit different from the conventional YAML.\n\n````\n---\ntags: in/paper state/process\naliases:\n  - {{VALUE:title}}\ncssclass: null\nabstract: \u003e\n  {{VALUE:abstract}}\n---\n\n# {{VALUE:title}}\n\n---\nType:: [[\u0026]]\nTitle:: {{VALUE:title}}\nAuthor:: {{VALUE:author}}\nYear:: {{VALUE:year}}\nTags:: \nDOI:: {{VALUE:doi}}\nCitekey:: {{VALUE:id}}\nZoteroURI:: [Open in Zotero: {{VALUE:title}}]({{VALUE:zoteroSelectURI}})\nReviewedDate:: [[{{DATE:gggg-MM-DD - ddd MMM D}}]]\nRating:: ==Give a rating==\n\n---\n\n## Citation\n```latex\n\n```\n\n## Abstract\n{{VALUE:abstract}}\n\n## Summary of key points\n- \n\n## Other Comments\n-\n\n## Interesting Cited References \n- \n\n---\n{{VALUE:note}}\n````\n\nEvery metadata property will be filled out by QuickAdd, except the tags and rating. Notably, the `ZoteroURI` property will contain a link which, when clicked, will open Zotero with the target paper selected. The `ReviewedDate` property will link to my daily note. Besides those, the remaining properties will just contain data about the paper itself. Something I quite like is that the script automatically links to the author(s) with WikiLinks.\n\n### Setting up QuickAdd\n\nWe'll need to install a QuickAdd user script for this to work. The video shows you how to do so [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK3VDQsZJo\u0026t=1730s). You can grab the script [here](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Attachments/citationsManager.js).\n\nAt this point, we need to create a macro — if you haven't already. In QuickAdd, go to Manage Macros, and add a new macro. Once the macro has been added, go ahead and click Configure. You'll want to add the user script to the macro — I called it 'citationsManager'.\n\nNow, add a Template to the macro by clicking the Template button. My Template Choice looks like this:\n\n![Template choice](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210818160734.png)\n\nAnd you can't see it in the image, but I have Open enabled. Here's an explanation of the settings:\n\n-   **Template Path** is the path to my template. I'll share that with you in a moment.\n-   **File Name Format** is the format of my file names. I use \u0026 in front of papers for my file convention. The `{{VALUE:title}}` is necessary, as it grabs the paper's title and uses that — which happens through the script.\n-   I use **create in folder** because I put my source notes in an inputs folder.\n-   And lastly, **open**, which isn't visible. This is used to open the created file.\n\nThis is what your macro should look like.\n\n![Macro](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210816155927.png)\n\nHaving created the macro, all you need is a QuickAdd choice to activate it. Back in the main QuickAdd menu, add a Choice of the Macro type. Click ⚙ settings for it and select your newly created macro.\n\n## Creating notes in Obsidian from papers in Zotero\n\nNow that we're all set up, it's time to use the script!\n\nHaving read a paper, I'll go into Obsidian and activate the `📜 Add Paper` choice. A menu like this will open:\n\n![](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819164144.png)\n\nSelecting a paper will create a new note, which looks like this:\n\n![Created note](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819164254.png)\n\nThis paper has no DOI, which would otherwise be filled out.\n\nSo there it is. This is how I import papers into my vault; notes, metadata, and all.\n\n## How you can use it\n\nAny of the following variables can be accessed with `{{VALUE:variable}}`, where `variable` is the name of the variable. Most of these are from the Citations plugin, but I've added a few extra ones for convenience.\n\nThese can be used in your Template Choice as well as your markdown template.\n\n-   `fileName` — paper title with all the special, illegal characters removed\n-   `citekey`\n-   `id` — also citekey\n-   `author` — all authors in linked format\n-   `doi` and `DOI`\n-   `abstract`\n-   `authorString`\n-   `containerTitle`\n-   `eprint`\n-   `eprinttype`\n-   `eventPlace`\n-   `note`\n-   `page`\n-   `publisher`\n-   `publisherPlace`\n-   `title`\n-   `URL`\n-   `year`\n-   `zoteroSelectURI`\n-   `type`\n-   `issueDate`\n\nYou can go into settings for the script and toggle force ignore of any empty properties. This means that, any properties that are undefined will be empty and won't be prompted for.\n\n![Script settings](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819165815.png)\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nAny questions, requests, or otherwise?

Using the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) syntax, it can be expressed as:\n\n    - trigger: "hello"  replace: "world"\n\n#### Multi-line expansions\n\nTo replace the original text with a multi-line expansion, we can either use the `\\n` line terminator character, such as:\n\n    - trigger: "hello"  replace: "line1\\nline2"\n\n\u003e Notice that when using `\\n` as the line terminator character, quotes are needed.\n\nOr values can span multiple lines using `|` or `\u003e`. Spanning multiple lines using a _Literal Block Scalar_ `|` will include the newlines and any trailing spaces. Using a _Folded Block Scalar_ `\u003e` will fold newlines to spaces; it’s used to make what would otherwise be a very long line easier to read and edit. In either case the indentation will be ignored. Examples are:\n\n    - trigger: "include newlines"  replace: |            exactly as you see            will appear these three            lines of poetry\n\n    - trigger: "fold newlines"  replace: \u003e            this is really a            single line of text            despite appearances\n\n\u003e Notice how no quotes are needed\n\nThere are a number of characters that are special (or reserved) and cannot be used as the first character of an unquoted scalar: ``\' " [] {} \u003e | * \u0026 ! % # ` @``\n\nThese kind of expansions are simple text replacements and are _static_.\n\n### Dynamic Matches\n\nStatic matches are suitable for many tasks, but can be problematic when we need an **expansion that changes dynamically**. For those situations, espanso introduces the concepts of **variables** and **extensions**.\n\n**Variables** can be used in the **replace** clause of a Match to include the _output_ of a dynamic component, the **extension**. To make things more clear, let\'s see an example:\n\nWe want to create a match that, everytime we type `:now`, it expands it to include the current time, like:\n\nLet\'s add the following match to a configuration file, such as the `default.yml` config.\n\n    - trigger: ":now"  replace: "It\'s {{mytime}}"  vars:    - name: mytime      type: date      params:        format: "%H:%M"\n\nAnd restart espanso with:\n\nAt this point, everytime we type `:now`, we should see something like: `It\'s 09:33`!\n\nLet\'s analyze the match step by step:\n\nIn the first line we declare the trigger `:now`, that must be typed by the user to expand the match.\n\n      replace: "It\'s {{mytime}}"\n\nIn the second line, we declare the _replace text_ as usual, but this time we include the `mytime` **variable**, that will contain the output of the **extension** used below.\n\n      vars:    - name: mytime      type: date\n\nIn the next lines, we defined the `mytime` variable as type **date**. The type of a variable defines the **extension** that will be executed to calculate its value. In this case, we use the [Date Extension](https://espanso.org/#date-extension).\n\nIn the remaining lines we declared the **parameters** used by the extension, in this case the _date format_.\n\n### Global Variables\n\nIntroduced in version 0.5.0, _global variables_ allow the definition of variables that can be used in all matches. In your `default.yml` file, you can add:\n\n    global_vars:  - name: "global1"    type: "shell"    params:      cmd: "echo global var"  - name: "greet"    type: "dummy"    params:      echo: "Hey"\n\nAt this point, you can use `global1` and `greet` in all your matches:\n\n    - trigger: ":hello"  replace: "{{greet}} Jon"\n\nAnd typing `:hello` will result in `Hey Jon`.\n\n### Cursor Hints\n\nLet\'s say you want to use espanso to expand some HTML code snippets, such as:\n\n      - trigger: ":div"    replace: "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"\n\nWith this match, any time you type `:div` you get the `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e` expansion, with the cursor at the end.\n\nWhile being useful, this snippet would have been much more convenient if **the cursor was positioned between the tags**, such as `\u003cdiv\u003e|\u003c/div\u003e`.\n\nStarting from version 0.3.2, espanso supports **cursor hints**, a way to control the position of the cursor after the expansion.\n\nUsing them is very simple, just insert `$|[[ReadItLater]] [[Article]]\n\n# [Matches | Espanso](https://espanso.org/docs/matches/)\n\n where you want the cursor to be positioned, in this case:\n\n      - trigger: ":div"    replace: "\u003cdiv\u003e$|$\u003c/div\u003e"\n\nIf you now type `:div`, you get the `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e` expansion, with the cursor between the tags!\n\n#### Things to keep in mind\n\n*   You can only define **one cursor hint** per match. Multiple hints will be ignored. If you need multiple hints, a decent replacement would be to use [Forms](https://espanso.org/docs/forms/)\n*   This feature should be used with care in **multiline** expansions, as it may yield **unexpected results** when using it in code editors that support **auto indenting**. This is due to the way the feature is implemented: espanso simulates a series of `left arrow` key-presses to position the cursor in the correct position. This works perfectly in single line replacements or in non-autoindenting fields, but can be problematic in code editors, as they automatically insert indentations that modify the number of required presses in a way espanso is not capable to detect.\n\n### Word Triggers\n\nIf you ever thought about using espanso as an **autocorrection tool for typos**, you may have experienced this problem:\n\nLet\'s say you occasionally type `ther` instead of `there`. Before the introduction of _word triggers_, you could have used espanso like this:\n\n      - trigger: "ther"    replace: "there"\n\nThis would correctly replace `ther` with `there`, but it also has the problem of expanding `other` into `othere`, making it unusable.\n\nWith _word triggers_ you can now add the `word: true` property to a match, telling espanso to only trigger that match if surrounded by _word separators_ ( such as _spaces_, _commas_ and _newlines_). So in this case it becomes:\n\n      - trigger: "ther"    replace: "there"    word: true\n\nAt this point, espanso will only expand `ther` into `there` when used as a standalone word. For instance:\n\n| Before | After |\n| --- | --- |\n| Is ther anyone else? | Is there anyone else? |\n| I have other interests | I have other interests |\n\n### Multiple triggers\n\nStarting from version 0.5.1, espanso supports _multi-trigger_ matches, which allows the user to specify multiple triggers to expand the same match. To use the feature, simply specify a list of triggers in the `triggers` field (instead of `trigger`):\n\n    - triggers: ["hello", "hi"]  replace: "world"\n\nNow typing either `hello` or `hi` will be expanded to `world`.\n\n### Case propagation\n\nStarting from version 0.5.1, espanso supports _case-propagating_ matches, which allows the user to expand a match so that the **trigger case style is preserved**.\n\nFor example, imagine you want to speedup writing the word `although`. You can define a word match as:\n\n      - trigger: "alh"    replace: "although"    word: true\n\nAs of now, this trigger will only be able to be expanded to the **lowercase** `although`. If we now add `propagate_case: true` to the match:\n\n      - trigger: "alh"    replace: "although"    propagate_case: true    word: true\n\nwe are now able to propagate the case style to the match:\n\n*   If you write `alh`, the match will be expanded to `although`.\n*   If you write `Alh`, the match will be expanded to `Although`.\n*   If you write `ALH`, the match will be expanded to `ALTHOUGH`.\n\n### Image Matches\n\nIn version 0.4.0, espanso added the possibility to **expand matches into images**. This can be useful in many situations, such as when writing emails or chatting.\n\n![Image match example](https://espanso.org/assets/images/imagematches-c2246e63acf2020a6ce1674ec6ce05fc.gif)\n\nThe syntax is pretty similar to the standard one, except you have to specify `image_path` instead of `replace`. This will be the path to your image.\n\n      - trigger: ":cat"    image_path: "/path/to/image.png"\n\nOn Windows and macOS, most commonly used formats (such as PNG, JPEG and GIF) should work as expected. On Linux, **you should generally use PNG** as it\'s the most compatible.\n\n#### Path convention\n\nWhile you can use any valid path in the `image_path` field, there are times in which it proves limited. For example, if you are synchronizing your configuration across different machines, you could have problems creating the same path on each of them.\n\nIn those cases, the best solution is to create a folder into the espanso configuration directory and put all your images there. At this point, you can use the `$CONFIG` variable in `image_path` to avoid hard-coding the path. For example:\n\nCreate the `images` folder inside the espanso configuration directory (the one which contains the `default.yml` file), and store all your images there. Let\'s say I stored the `cat.png` image. We can now create a Match with:\n\n      - trigger: ":cat"    image_path: "$CONFIG/images/cat.png"\n\n### Nested Matches\n\nIntroduced in version 0.5.0, _nested matches_ allow to include the output of a match inside another one.\n\n    - trigger: ":one"  replace: "nested"- trigger: ":nested"  replace: "This is a {{output}} match"  vars:    - name: output      type: match      params:        trigger: ":one"\n\nAt this point, if you type `:nested` you\'ll see `This is a nested match appear`.\n\n### Forms\n\nSince version 0.7.0, espanso is capable of creating arbirarly complex input forms.\n\n![Espanso Form](https://espanso.org/assets/images/macform-e187d4291308dbccb2f2e346be45aa6b.png)\n\nThese open up a world of possibilities, allowing the user to create matches with many arguments, as well as injecting those values into custom Scripts or Shell commands.\n\nFor more informations, visit the [Forms section](https://espanso.org/docs/forms/).\n\n### Script Extension\n\nThere will be tasks for which espanso was not designed for. For those cases, espanso offers the **Script Extension**, that enables you to call an **external script**, written in **any language**, and use its output in a match.\n\nTo better understand this feature, let\'s dive into an example:\n\nWe want to expand a match into the output of a **Python** script. Let\'s create the `script.py` file, place it anywhere you want and paste the following code:\n\n    print("Hello from python")\n\nNow take note of the **path** of the script, and add the following match to the espanso configuration:\n\n    - trigger: ":pyscript"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: script      params:        args:          - python          - /path/to/your/script.py\n\nAs always, restart espanso with `espanso restart`. If you now try to type `:pyscript` anywhere, you should see `Hello from python` appear.\n\nYou can do the same thing with any programming language, just change the `args` array accordingly.\n\n#### Script Placement\n\nThe current best-practice when creating Script matches is to create a `scripts` directory in the `espanso` directory and store the scripts there.\n\nThat way, you can use the `%CONFIG%` wildcard to automatically replace the config directory with the correct path, such as:\n\n    - trigger: ":pyscript"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: script      params:        args:          - python          - "%CONFIG%/scripts/script.py"\n\nThis makes it easier to create matches that work across many machines.\n\n#### A note on performance\n\nBecause of the execution time, you should limit yourself to fast-running scripts to avoid any lag.\n\n#### Useful Environment Variables\n\nWhen triggering the shell command, espanso also injects a few useful Environment Variables that you can use:\n\n*   `CONFIG`: Points to the path of the espanso config directory\n*   All the values of the previously evaluated match variables. For more information, look at the [Advanced topics](https://espanso.org/#advanced-topics) section.\n\n### Shell Extension\n\nThe **Shell Extension** is similar to the [Script Extension](https://espanso.org/#script-extension), but instead of executing a script, it executes **shell commands**. This offers a lot of flexibility on Unix systems thanks to the `bash` shell (and thanks to WSL support also on Windows).\n\nLet\'s say you regularly send your IP address to your coworkers. You can setup a match to fetch your public IP from [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/).\n\n\u003e Note: this example uses the `curl` command, usually preinstalled in most Unix systems.\n\n    - trigger: ":ip"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: shell      params:        cmd: "curl \'https://api.ipify.org\'"\n\nAs always, restart espanso with `espanso restart`. Now everytime you type `:ip`, it gets expanded to your public IP address!\n\n#### Choosing the Shell\n\nThe shell extension supports many different shells out of the box. By default it uses:\n\n*   `Powershell` on Windows\n*   `bash` on Linux\n*   `sh` on macOS\n\nYou can also specify different shells by using the `shell` param. For example, let\'s say we want to use bash on Windows through the `Windows Subsystem for Linux`. We would use:\n\n    - trigger: ":ip"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: shell      params:        cmd: "curl \'https://api.ipify.org\'"        shell: wsl\n\nOther possible values for the `shell` parameter are:\n\n*   On Windows: `cmd`, `powershell`, `wsl`\n*   On macOS: `sh`, `bash`\n*   On Linux: `sh`, `bash`\n\n#### Bash pipes\n\nThis extension also supports bash **pipes** as your shell does, such as:\n\n    - trigger: ":localip"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: shell      params:        cmd: "ip a | grep \'inet 192\' | awk \'{ print $2 }\'"\n\n#### Trimming the output\n\nIt\'s very common for commands to have outputs that also spawn a newline at the end. By default a trim option is enabled to remove any excess spaces/newlines. You can optionally disable the `trim` option:\n\n    - trigger: ":localip"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: shell      params:        cmd: "ip a | grep \'inet 192\' | awk \'{ print $2 }\'"        trim: false\n\n#### Useful Environment Variables\n\nWhen triggering the shell command, espanso also injects a few useful Environment Variables that you can use:\n\n*   `CONFIG`: Points to the path of the espanso config directory\n*   All the values of the previously evaluated match variables. For more information, look at the [Advanced topics](https://espanso.org/#advanced-topics) section.\n\n#### Using Linux commands on Windows\n\nAs you might have already understood from previous sections, espanso supports the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) through the `shell: wsl` parameter. This allows Windows users to execute Linux commands from their machine.\n\n#### Debugging\n\nSometimes it\'s useful to understand what get\'s executed exactly, what are the return codes and error messages returned by the command. In order to do that, you can use the `debug: true` option:\n\n    - trigger: ":localip"  replace: "{{output}}"  vars:    - name: output      type: shell      params:        cmd: "ip a | grep \'inet 192\' | awk \'{ print $2 }\'"        debug: true\n\nAt this point, after triggering a match, the logs will be populated with useful information. Too see them, use the `espanso log` command.\n\n### Date Extension\n\nThe **Date Extension** can be used to include _date_ and _time_ information in a match.\n\nThe most important aspect to consider when using this extension is the `format` parameter, that specifies how the date will be rendered. A **list of all the possible options** can be found in the [official chrono documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.3.1/chrono/format/strftime/index.html).\n\n    - trigger: ":now"  replace: "It\'s {{mytime}}"  vars:    - name: mytime      type: date      params:        format: "%H:%M"\n\n### Random Extension\n\nIntroduced in version 0.4.1, the **Random Extension** can be used to write non-deterministic replacement texts. Said in other words, you can now specify a set of possible expansions for a match, useful to avoid repetitions.\n\nYou can use this feature by declaring a variable of type `random` and then passing a number of `choices` as a parameter:\n\n      - trigger: ":quote"    replace: "{{output}}"    vars:      - name: output        type: random        params:          choices:            - "Every moment is a fresh beginning."            - "Everything you can imagine is real."            - "Whatever you do, do it well."\n\nIn this case, typing `:quote` will expand randomly to one of the tree quotes.\n\n### Clipboard Extension\n\nIntroduced in version 0.5.1, the **Clipboard Extension** now allows to include the current clipboard content in a match, which can be useful in many situations.\n\nFor example, let\'s imagine you want to create the ultimate HTML link shortcut:\n\n      - trigger: ":a"    replace: "\u003ca href=\'{{clipboard}}\' /\u003e$|$\u003c/a\u003e"    vars:      - name: "clipboard"        type: "clipboard"\n\nIf you now copy a link in the clipboard (for example by selecting it and then CTRL+C) and then type `:a`, you\'ll see the following replacement appear:\n\n    \u003ca href=\'YOUR_COPIED_LINK\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n### Advanced Topics\n\nStarting from version 0.7.0, most variables can now _use_ the value of other (previously declared) variables in their body.\n\nNot all variable types support variable injection, but notably Shell and Script extensions do through the use of ad-hoc environment variables. Take the following example:\n\nLet\'s say we want to reverse the string produced by the Date Extension:\n\n    - trigger: ":reversed"  replace: "Reversed {{myshell}}"  vars:    - name: mytime      type: date      params:        format: "%H:%M"    - name: myshell      type: shell      params:        cmd: "echo $ESPANSO_MYTIME | rev"\n\nThis match produces the result we expected. If the current time was `11:54`, it produces:\n\nLet\'s analyze it step by step:\n\n1.  Variable `mytime` is evaluated first (as it\'s the first declared in the `vars` list).\n2.  It\'s output is injected in the `myshell` shell command, in particular through the `$ESPANSO_MYTIME` env variable.\n3.  The result is piped through the unix `rev` command\n4.  Finally the output is included in the `replace` text and expanded.\n\nAs you might have already guessed, the previous variables are injected in the Shell variable (and the Script extension works in the same way) with the naming `ESPANSO_UPPERCASE-VAR-NAME`.\n\n\u003e Make sure to avoid spaces in the variable names, as they can become problematic in this situation\n\nIf you are using **global variables**, you have to be careful in this case, as they are implicitly evaluated before the local ones.\n\nIf you need to evaluate a global variable **after** a local one (which might be necessary if you want to inject another variable value inside it), you can do so as follows:\n\n    # Considering the following global variableglobal_vars:  - name: "reversed"    type: shell    params:      cmd: "echo $ESPANSO_VARNAME | rev"matches:  - trigger: ":rev"    replace: "{{reversed}}"    vars:      - name: "varname"        type: echo        params:          echo: "hello"      - name: "reversed"        type: "global"\n\nThe key element here is the `global` type, which tells espanso to evaluate variable `reversed` only at that point, and not before `varname`.',title:"Untitled Page"},"/ReadItLater-Inbox/Youtube---Zettelkasten-Smart-Notes-Step-by-Step-with-Obsidian---YouTube":{content:'[[ReadItLater]] [[001.Notes/ict.Youtube]]\n\n# [Zettelkasten Smart Notes: Step by Step with Obsidian - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziE6UExsOrs)\n\n\u003ciframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ziE6UExsOrs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e',title:"Untitled Page"},"/_Spaces/work/0.NEED-to-DO!":{content:"# Things I need to do      \n#todo #to-do\n\n## Read!

During the same period, a positive correlation can be seen with members of the diaspora returning to the country. According to government estimates, over 500,000 Vietnamese return to Vietnam each year to work, live, and retire. Among these returnees are a group who have made Viet Nam their home: the Western-born, second generation. This presentation explores the significance of online community memberships in the construction of identity and belonging among Western-born Vietnamese who “return” to their ancestral homeland. Drawing on 31 in-depth interviews with second generation Vietnamese living in Viet Nam, from 12 disparate Western countries, it examines when, how, and why they use information communication technologies to create identity and spaces of belonging. Employing a framework of social and migrant capital theories, I reveal the obstacles and advantages these return migrants encounter with belonging as they coexist with other western-born coethnics and locals in their ancestral homeland. A focus on the outcomes of various belongings between coethnics and locals is examined to demonstrate how returnees' various capitals are impacted. My preliminary findings suggest that when confronted with exclusion and feelings of non-belonging, returnees seek out the familiar whether online or offline: other Western-born expats.\n\n\n## Comments from Tamsin [Barber](005.Authors/Barber.md) and Lan Anh [Hoang](005.Authors/Hoang.md)\n- One thing you may wish to focus on (if not in the abstract but in the presentation) would be the **outcomes of different kinds of belongings**.  \n- If some participants \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFB8EBA6;\"\u003eexperience more belonging with other western co-ethnics in VN rather than Vietnamese locals, how does that impact their social and cultural capital in their new lives in Vietnam and vice versa?  \u003c/mark\u003e \n- Likewise, \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003edo particular experiences of exclusion or non-belonging lead returnees to identify or seek belonging with particular groups?  \u003c/mark\u003e \n  \nIf you do want to add anything into the abstract please do and return it to us before March 15th.  \n  \nWe really look forward to discussing this with you in June/July.\n\n## Theories, concepts, and ideas to employ\n### Theories\n- Ray [[005.Authors/Oldenburg]] and [Third Places](_Spaces/work/Conferences/2022.EuroSEAS_(dan%20presentation).md#Third%20Places)\n- [erel](005.Authors/erel.md)'s concept of [migrant capital](008.Theory/migrant%20capital.md)\n- [small](005.Authors/small.md)\n	- [2019.small-How Vietnamese in the US and beyond fuel dreams with remittances](002.Literature%20Notes/2019.small-How%20Vietnamese%20in%20the%20US%20and%20beyond%20fuel%20dreams%20with%20remittances.md)\n### Ideas\n- covid as accentuating/accelerating social media as a third space\n- metaverse\n\n### Third Places\nAccording to [this article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444806061953), a virtual third place fails to encompass these three criteria: \n1. third places emphasize localized community;\n	1.

Lan Anh [Hoang](005.Authors/Hoang.md), Associate Professor in Development Studies, The University of Melbourne, Australia, lahoang@unimelb.edu.au\n3. Dan Le, PhD Student in Social Anthropogy, Kanazawa University, Japan, danle@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp\n\n### Panel Description\n\nThe changing nature of the international Vietnamese diaspora can be largely attributed to a growth in transnational migration from Vietnam since the launch of the Đổi mới reform in the late 1980s. This has included two main categories - labour migration and international student migration. In 2018, contract labour migrants numbered 500,000, the majority of which were hosted in Taiwan, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Irregular migration has also constituted an important form of labour migration, without reliable statistical data, qualitative research indicates significant volumes of cross-border migration to China and Southeast Asia as well as temporary migration to Europe and Northern Africa. The number of Vietnamese students overseas in 2020 reached 190,000, according to The Ministry of Education and Training, placing Vietnam in the top ten biggest student sending countries in the world (destined mainly for United States, Australia, and Canada). These unprecedented opportunities for migration and mobility raise important questions about the on-going changes in Vietnamese diasporic communities, the proliferation of transnational networks and the shifting nature of citizenship and belonging. Citizenship is processual and performative. Belonging, on the other hand, is not fixed or ahistorical but subject to displacement by changing social, economic, and political circumstances.\n\nThis panel will offer reflections on the relationship between established diasporas and newer migrant communities in the Vietnamese diaspora according to networks, citizenship and belonging. Our presentations will be focused on, but not restricted to, the following questions:\n\n- How have recent patterns of Vietnamese migration transformed social relations within and between established Vietnamese diaspora communities?\n	- \u003cmark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"\u003e2nd gen VK returnees mentioning that they are better able to connect with the real "viet kieu", or viet-born outward migrants who return\n		- marty, Tue AC, \u003c/mark\u003e \n- What role do translocal and transnational networks play in sustaining and transforming Vietnamese diasporic communities?\n	- \u003cmark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"\u003enew media (ICTs) as a space where migrants find community. With the emergence of new media, it is no longer simple to define localities as physical spaces\u003c/mark\u003e \n- How are the changing policies towards migrants in various ‘host’ societies reshaping the contours and experiences of the Vietnamese migrants and the diaspora in specific national contexts?\n	- in VN phenotypically similar in some circumstances. although some may look obviously "western" from their clothing/dress/facial hair\n	- the way that 2nd and subsequent generations are treated in settlement countries foreshadows what viet economic/labor migrants may face there. racism and discrimination as factors contributing to moving back\n	- Matas illustrates that policy racism (or official racism) might start from restrictions in visa requirements where nationals of some countries are required to have visas in order to enter a country, whereas others enter visa-free. 1 [This article.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021934716680323)\n		- loan, \n	- Also, nationals of some countries are put under strict secondary examination at the ports of entry as well as frequent checks (ethnic profiling) within the host society, whereas nationals of others are not. Also, refugee claimants from some countries are easily accepted and granted refugee status, while others, fleeing the same or similar oppressions, repressions, or violence, are quickly refused (Matas, 1994, p. 15).\n	- Belonging involves ‘the desire for some sort of attachment, be it to other people, places or modes of being’ (Probyn 1996, 19). [From this article.](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/152936/1/152936.pdf)\n		- According to Agnew, places are fixed or mobile locations that have a real material or imaginary form and further possess a ‘sense of place’, which is the emotional and subjective attachment individuals have to it (Cresswell 2004, 7). Thus, a sense of place may give rise to reflections and interpretations of rootedness and heritage and so provides attachments to certain locations. Places that affect humans’ sense of belonging are those in which people feel comfortable or at home. Such places are found at various scales, such as the domestic, the local, the regional, the national, and even the supranational levels (Rose 1995, 88–91). These may be neighbourhoods, villages, regions, nation-states, or even larger entities. Direct personal interaction with these may bring about the negotiation of allegiances (Gustafson 2009, 492).\n			- the spatial may also be virtual/digital/online setting\n\n89 Paper I\n\n1996, 19).\n- How do migration and mobility reconfigure Vietnamese migrants’ understanding of citizenship and sense of belonging?\n- What implications does increased mobility have for Vietnamese transnational subjects’ on-going power struggles within nation-states over recognition and identity?\n\nPanel format Single session (1 x 90 min.): 4 presenters\n\nReconfiguring-the-international-Vietnamese-diaspora-and-post-Đổi-mới-migration.-Citizenship-Networks-and-Belonging![](Attachments/PDFs/Reconfiguring-the-international-Vietnamese-diaspora-and-post-Đổi-mới-migration.-Citizenship-Networks-and-Belonging%201.pdf)',title:"EuroSEAS"},"/_Spaces/work/Journals-to-publish-in":{content:"In conversation with [phi hong su](005.Authors/Su.md)\npublish in very high journals with intention that paper would be rejected but with great commentary. fix paper and then submit to lower tier journal.\n- journalguide.com \n- AJS\n- JSR\n- socius\n- JEMS\n- Ethnic racial studies\n- amerasia journal\n- Journal of Vietnamese Studies \n- journal of gender studies ([https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2021.1988531](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2021.1988531))\n- International Migration Review (slow and Don't do this per phi)\n- [social media + society](https://journals.sagepub.com/author-instructions/SMS#ArticleTypes)",title:"Journals to publish in"},"/private/090.acknowlegements":{content:"keito and sora\nfolks in LA\ndave\nphi conversations from day one\ntamsin conversation dec 2021\nalvin book club\njohn tran\nvincent tran\njulien book club\ninterviewees \nderrace\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/private/private-note":{content:"This page doesn't get published!",title:"Private Stuff"},"/quartz-help-readmes/Quartz-Help-Readmes":{content:"- Jacky Zhao's Quartz Page https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n- espanso default.yml file\n	- :git1\n	- :git2\n	- :git3\n	- :dt = current date and time",title:"Quartz Help Readmes"},"/templates/000.post":{content:"",title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/Author-Template":{content:"# {{Name}}\n\n## Bio\n- \n\n## Literature\n### Monographs \n- \n\n### Articles \n- \n\n## Literature Notes\n-",title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/Mdnotes-Default-Template":{content:"{{title}}\n\n  \n\n![[%(metadataFileName)#Metadata]]\n\n  \n\nOther files:\n\n{{mdnotesFileName}}\n\n{{metadataFileName}}\n\n  \n\n## Zotero links\n\n{{localLibrary}}\n\n{{cloudLibrary}}\n\n  \n\n## Notes",title:"Untitled Page"},"/templates/template.dailynotes":{content:'# Daily Notes \n---\n\ncreation date: \u003c% tp.file.creation_date() %\u003e\nmodification date: \u003c% tp.file.last_modified_date("YYYY MMMM Do (dddd)  HH:mm:ss") %\u003e\n\n---\n\n\u003c\u003c[[\u003c% tp.date.yesterday("YYYY.MM.DD") %\u003e]] ｜ [[\u003c% tp.date.tomorrow("YYYY.MM.DD") %\u003e]]\u003e\u003e\n\n',title:"Untitled Page"},"/writing-a-scientific-paper":{content:'from kanazawa academies webinar\n\n# methodology section\n## words to use\n- using strong "\u003cmark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"\u003eactive\u003c/mark\u003e " words. for example use of theoretical framework. \n	- "this study \u003cmark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"\u003eembraces\u003c/mark\u003e network analysis..."\n	-',title:"writing a scientific paper"}};for(const[b,a]of Object.entries(scrapedContent))contentIndex.add({id:b,title:a.title,content:removeMarkdown(a.content)});const highlight=(i,j)=>{const a=20,k=j.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),b=i.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),f=a=>k.some(b=>a.toLowerCase().startsWith(b.toLowerCase())),d=b.map(f);let e=0,g=0;for(let b=0;b<Math.max(d.length-a,0);b++){const f=d.slice(b,b+a),c=f.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0);c>=e&&(e=c,g=b)}const c=Math.max(g-a,0),h=Math.min(c+2*a,b.length),l=b.slice(c,h).map(a=>{return f(a)?`<span class="search-highlight">${a}</span>`:a}).join(" ").replaceAll('</span> <span class="search-highlight">'," ");return`${c===0?"":"..."}${l}${h===b.length?"":"..."}`},resultToHTML=({url:b,title:c,content:d,term:a})=>{const e=removeMarkdown(d),f=highlight(c,a),g=highlight(e,a);return`<button class="result-card" id="${b}">

Unfortunately, another disruption in the slowly settling security situation came with the 2008 financial and economic crisis. Just two years before the crisis, the Czech job market was opened up to the Vietnamese labour force, and some 20,000 Vietnamese migrant workers appeared in the CR. Almost all of them lost their jobs after the 2008 financial, and consequent economic, crisis. The economic situation within the diaspora was also downgraded because of the economic crisis. Those at the economic margins of the diaspora, such as the migrant workers and the newcomers, frequently opted for "an alternative way of economic survival" in this situation. As a consequence of their desperate economic situation, they joined the illegal part of the diaspora and were engaged in the production of illegal cigarettes and alcohol, the growing of cannabis, violent crimes such as racketeering and various forms of intimidation and so forth.

The "traditional" crime groups (such as the triads, the yakuza, the chao pho or the geondal) are formalised, rather rigorous groups based on traditional forms—they have their own name, an established "turf", a certain continuity, a relatively stable hierarchical structure and a restricted membership.

There will always be of course a group of people that will be relatively isolated from the main society and thus vulnerable to various forms of socio-economic subjectivation.

During the 1980s, as a result of the three wars in Indochina, an inefficient state-planned economy, and the bad politico-economic situation in the Communist Eastern Bloc, the Vietnamese economy stood over its own perdition. Due to the ill-realised land and financial reforms, people from many Vietnamese provinces faced starvation or great economic difficulties (The Economist 2002; Crosette 1988). The GDP per capita did not reach US$200 (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 83), the annual rate of inflation soared to over 700% and the value of Vietnamese exports did not constitute even half of the total value of the country's imports, which barely reached US$1221 million. Due to military expenditures, the budget resources were almost depleted, government revenues were low and the fiscal deficit was large and persistent (Arkadie and Mallon 2003: 67). As a result of the bad economic situation, wide-scale reforms (đổi mới) were launched at Hanoi's Sixth Communist Party Congress in December 1986.

These licenced labour agencies were organised similarly as the unlicenced ones, providing entrance visas and transportation, and legalising the migrants\' stays in the Czech Republic. In Vietnam, there were agencies that were responsible for recruiting workers, worker training, obtaining working visas and the transfer of the workers into the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, there were partner labour agencies that were responsible for the distribution of workers according to the momentary needs of Czech companies and practically the whole agenda regarding the employment of their clients (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 122). According to Vietnamese sources, the agencies usually charged US$6500-15,000 for their services in 2007-2010. The export of the labour force was therefore profitable, and the agencies were interested in importing as many workers as possible, regardless of the needs of the Czech labour market. It was a major fault of the Czech immigration policy that the Czech Government was not able to introduce any effective control of the Vietnamese labour agencies\' activities and predominantly focused its attention only on the visa regimes. This strategy soon backfired. Mainly the weakly controlled agencies\' imports of labourers caused a dramatic increase in the number of Vietnamese residents in the Czech Republic, as it increased by 20,000 persons (approximately one-third of the diaspora),"('}],"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=51":[{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=51",text:"note on p.51)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=51",text:'"42 M.

Instead, they adopt more fluid, transnational identities as "Korean Americans" who embody the best of both America and South Korea, or more expansive ethnic identities as "globalized Koreans.""('},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=23",text:"Tsuda.Song 2019:23"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/kim-park-nelson",text:"kim park nelson"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/in-between",text:"in-between"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=23",text:"note on p.23)"}],"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees":[{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/lipmanCampsVietnameseRefugees2020",text:"lipmanCampsVietnameseRefugees2020"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=10",text:"note on p.10)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=10",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:"note on p.13)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:"note on p.13)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=162",text:"note on p.162)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=162",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=163",text:"note on p.163)"}],"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic":[{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/_Spaces/work/Book-Reviews",text:"Book Reviews"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/Su",text:"Phi Hong Su"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/schwenkel",text:"Schwenkel"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/Su",text:"Phi Hong Su"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/2020nozinavietnameseorganizedcrime",text:"2020nozinaVietnameseOrganizedCrime"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"Nožina.Kraus 2020:12"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"note on p.12)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:'"Together with the new immigrants from Vietnam, new kinds of crime have appeared in the CR as well."('},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"note on p.12)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:'"At the top, the two components are connected by a special figure, the respected man and criminal boss.

The "traditional" crime groups (such as the triads, the yakuza, the chao pho or the geondal) are formalised, rather rigorous groups based on traditional forms—they have their own name, an established "turf", a certain continuity, a relatively stable hierarchical structure and a restricted membership.

The reasons lie in the economic situation of Vietnam, the efforts of many ordinary Vietnamese to improve their lives and ensure a better future for their children, the Vietnamese government's policy of support of economic migration abroad, and the dubious activities of numerous broker agencies profiting from the migration. During the 1980s, as a result of the three wars in Indochina, an inefficient state-planned economy, and the bad politico-economic situation in the Communist Eastern Bloc, the Vietnamese economy stood over its own perdition. Due to the ill-realised land and financial reforms, people from many Vietnamese provinces faced starvation or great economic difficulties (The Economist 2002; Crosette 1988). The GDP per capita did not reach US$200 (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 83), the annual rate of inflation soared to over 700% and the value of Vietnamese exports did not constitute even half of the total value of the country's imports, which barely reached US$1221 million. Due to military expenditures, the budget resources were almost depleted, government revenues were low and the fiscal deficit was large and persistent (Arkadie and Mallon 2003: 67). As a result of the bad economic situation, wide-scale reforms (đổi mới) were launched at Hanoi's Sixth Communist Party Congress in December 1986. The resulting new Vietnamese economic model, which can be characterised as a multi-sector socialist-oriented market economy using both directive and indicative planning, was partly successful.

Unfortunately, another disruption in the slowly settling security situation came with the 2008 financial and economic crisis. Just two years before the crisis, the Czech job market was opened up to the Vietnamese labour force, and some 20,000 Vietnamese migrant workers appeared in the CR. Almost all of them lost their jobs after the 2008 financial, and consequent economic, crisis. The economic situation within the diaspora was also downgraded because of the economic crisis. Those at the economic margins of the diaspora, such as the migrant workers and the newcomers, frequently opted for "an alternative way of economic survival" in this situation.

Instead, they adopt more fluid, transnational identities as "Korean Americans" who embody the best of both America and South Korea, or more expansive ethnic identities as "globalized Koreans.""('},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=23",text:"Tsuda.Song 2019:23"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/kim-park-nelson",text:"kim park nelson"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/in-between",text:"in-between"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=23",text:"note on p.23)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/lipmanCampsVietnameseRefugees2020",text:"lipmanCampsVietnameseRefugees2020"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=10",text:"note on p.10)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=10",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:"note on p.13)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:"note on p.13)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=13",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=162",text:"note on p.162)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=162",text:""},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Lipman-In Camps Vietnamese Refugees",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX8KVHYE?page=163",text:"note on p.163)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/_Spaces/work/Book-Reviews",text:"Book Reviews"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/Su",text:"Phi Hong Su"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/schwenkel",text:"Schwenkel"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/005.Authors/Su",text:"Phi Hong Su"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/2020nozinavietnameseorganizedcrime",text:"2020nozinaVietnameseOrganizedCrime"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"Nožina.Kraus 2020:12"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"note on p.12)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:'"Together with the new immigrants from Vietnam, new kinds of crime have appeared in the CR as well."('},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:"note on p.12)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=12",text:'"At the top, the two components are connected by a special figure, the respected man and criminal boss.

This is so particularly in some poorer localities, such as Nghe An Province, Ha Tinh Province, and Quang Binh Province, from where a substantial part of the migrants to the Czech Republic is recruited (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 119).\"("},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/labor-migrants",text:"labor migrants"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=40",text:"note on p.40)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2020.Nozina and Kraus-Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M7MZLJQH?page=40",text:"\"So why are a lot of Vietnamese people willing to dip their families into a big debt and run a high risk of losing all of their family's property? The reasons lie in the economic situation of Vietnam, the efforts of many ordinary Vietnamese to improve their lives and ensure a better future for their children, the Vietnamese government's policy of support of economic migration abroad, and the dubious activities of numerous broker agencies profiting from the migration. During the 1980s, as a result of the three wars in Indochina, an inefficient state-planned economy, and the bad politico-economic situation in the Communist Eastern Bloc, the Vietnamese economy stood over its own perdition. Due to the ill-realised land and financial reforms, people from many Vietnamese provinces faced starvation or great economic difficulties (The Economist 2002; Crosette 1988). The GDP per capita did not reach US$200 (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 83), the annual rate of inflation soared to over 700% and the value of Vietnamese exports did not constitute even half of the total value of the country's imports, which barely reached US$1221 million. Due to military expenditures, the budget resources were almost depleted, government revenues were low and the fiscal deficit was large and persistent (Arkadie and Mallon 2003: 67). As a result of the bad economic situation, wide-scale reforms (đổi mới) were launched at Hanoi's Sixth Communist Party Congress in December 1986. The resulting new Vietnamese economic model, which can be characterised as a multi-sector socialist-oriented market economy using both directive and indicative planning, was partly successful.

These licenced labour agencies were organised similarly as the unlicenced ones, providing entrance visas and transportation, and legalising the migrants\' stays in the Czech Republic. In Vietnam, there were agencies that were responsible for recruiting workers, worker training, obtaining working visas and the transfer of the workers into the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, there were partner labour agencies that were responsible for the distribution of workers according to the momentary needs of Czech companies and practically the whole agenda regarding the employment of their clients (Nožina and Kraus 2012: 122).

Unfortunately, another disruption in the slowly settling security situation came with the 2008 financial and economic crisis. Just two years before the crisis, the Czech job market was opened up to the Vietnamese labour force, and some 20,000 Vietnamese migrant workers appeared in the CR. Almost all of them lost their jobs after the 2008 financial, and consequent economic, crisis. The economic situation within the diaspora was also downgraded because of the economic crisis. Those at the economic margins of the diaspora, such as the migrant workers and the newcomers, frequently opted for "an alternative way of economic survival" in this situation.
