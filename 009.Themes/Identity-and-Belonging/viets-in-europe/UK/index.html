And it was also during this same period in which an influx of western-born/raised Vietnamese from the diaspora began migrating in.\n\na. Unboundedness- ﻿Appadurai, for example, has argued that there is a need to reconceptualize the “landscapes of group identity,” a need that flows from the current world conjuncture in which “groups are no longer tightly territorialized, spatially bounded, historically unselfconscious, or culturally homogeneous” (1991:191).

Transnationalism\n\na. ﻿We define “transnationalism” as the processes by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement. We call these processes transnationalism to emphasize that many immigrants today build social fields that cross geographic, cultural, and political borders. Immigrants who develop and maintain multiple relationships—familial, economic, social, organizational, religious, and political—that span borders we call “**transmigrants**.” An essential element of transnationalism is the multiplicity of involvements that transmigrants’ sustain in both home and host societies. We are still groping for a language to describe these social locations. Transmigrants use the term “home” for their society of origin, even when they clearly have also made a home in their country of settlement. The migration literature describes the country of settlement as the “host,” but such a term, though compact and convenient, carries the often unwarranted connotations that the immigrant is both “welcome” and a “visitor.” Transmigrants take actions, make decisions, and develop subjectivities and identities embedded in networks of relationships that connect them simultaneously to two or more nation-states (p. 8) In glick-schiller and basch’s nation’s unbounded.\n\nb. Viet Nam (monosyllabic; why 2 words)\n\nc. Viet Kieu is a disputed term that will be used in this book. Viet Kieu literally means Sojourner of Vietnamese ancestry or overseas Vietnamese. It comes from the Chinese root, ___, and refers to those who have left Vietnam for another country. Some, including several informants in this manuscript, find the label to represent a power imbalance, especially when the word is used as a self-identifier. The term usually evokes images of a person who has left Viet Nam, typically to a country positioned higher geopolitically than Vietnam, owning at least one car, and living in the lap of luxury (citation required). Thus, the label is charged with privilege and economic inequality. Some of the informants in this research preferred labelling themselves Người ______ Gốc Việt (fill in the blank with the birth country. ie. Norwegian with Vietnamese roots) when asked where they were from by locals. With this in mind, Viet Kieu will be used herein for two reasons.\n\nd. First, while Viet Kieu is recognized as being unequal, it is a term that represents and bonds Coethnics within the diaspora. Some of the groups explored in this research use the term to label their own group (ie. Viet Kieus in Viet Nam, Viet Kieus for in Saigon etc.). Viet Kieu easily identifies those of Vietnamese ancestry who have lived abroad for any certain amount of time. It is a term \n\na. “Kieu bao” used by the State now to woo returnees and their Đông to Vietnam.\n\nb. Caroline’s words on VK in Transnationalizing Viet Nam book.\n\nc.

As social scientists, we see ourselves dialectically as both observers and the observed. At the same time, those about whom we write are both the subjects of our inquiry and subjects who, in relationship to what is being said and done around them, including the work of social scientists, and in relation to their own varying motivations, act upon and change the world of our inquiry. We, in turn, observe these actions and are influenced by them. What is more, we evaluate the actions, the beliefs, and the stance of our ﻿subjects. We are, as are all social scientists, whether or not it is acknowledged, positioned observers. Our perceptions, whether we objectify them by identifying them as “data” or as “texts,” are influenced by our position in the world and our positions about the state of the world.

Transnationalism refers to the multiple connections that migrants have to two countries or more. The definition of diaspora is contested among scholars that cannot agree on its criteria. Thus there are shortfalls and blindspots with these terms when discussing migration. How can these terms better help us understand the phenomenon of "return" migration, specifically the experiences of the 2nd and subsequent generations? Or those who may not identify with the "diaspora" but still nourish some ties to the ethnic homeland? How can we problematize these terms to help us better understand the increasing use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital attitudes of these groups? In this workshop, our aim is to promote a lively discussion around and question these well-used terms in the digital age we live in. \n\n\nOutline of Workshop\n- framing workshop around we are not the "experts" and instead are looking for support \n- defining terms **transnationalism**, diaspora\n- introduce our research\n	- how do we deal with these concepts in our own respective research?\n	- \n- how does the concept of "diaspora" connect with the 2nd/subsequent generations\n- Dan\'s: how is diaspora affected with ICTs with various online groups (youtube, FB, IG)\n- asking questions to the audience? how do all of you deal with these qusetions in your own researcH?\n- [[diasporicity]] [[tsuda]]\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n# Call for Papers Invitation\n**_Two Hybrid Workshops’ Invitation:_**\n\n**Academic Networking on Researching Migration, Identities** **Intra-Generational Conflicts** **and** **Negotiating of Intra-ethnic Partnerships** **or Sexualities**\n\n**in the Vietnamese Diaspora**\n\n**Venue:** The workshop will be organized in hybrid form, while the physical part will took place\n\n at the Department of Asian Studies, Faculty of Art, Palacký University třída Svobody\n\n 686/26, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic\n\n**Time:** 18-19 November 2021, 9:30am – 3:00pm\n\n**Call for Papers and Presentation Proposals**\n\nSince the 1970s, roughly four million people of Vietnamese descent are living in parts of diaspora all around the world. Originally, a significant part of the diaspora consists of political refugees. But, in the recent years, the majority of those migrants are economic migrants – either migrant workers or petty businessmen. As a result, the diaspora is divided, but even its younger strata is composed of relatively open communities, concentrated mainly around big trade and industrial centers, where Vietnamese communal live and ethnic economy merged together. Naturally, there are significant differences across different regions and locations of the diaspora. For example, unlike in the Czech Republic, Germany and Japan, the Vietnamese diaspora in Taiwan or in the U.S. is not (or no more) isolated. Also, due to the existence of the third and fourth generations in the diaspora, the situation is even more specific in France (and other so-called western countries), where the young people of Vietnamese descent may identify as French, but not fully.\n\nAs we can see from existing scholarship, the co-existence of the diaspora in all the host countries is a complicated matter. Due to the racial prejudices and xenophobia on the both sides, the Vietnamese diaspora´s members are (to certain degree) isolated from the society-at-large. Nevertheless, racial prejudices are not the sole perpetrator of the ostracization of migrants. Class, socio-economic statuses and, to some degree, cultural segregation are also prominent factors in shaping migrants’ experiences. Moreover, aspects such as sexuality and gender play important roles in conditioning the social lives, migration decision makings and practices, as well as identities of Vietnamese migrants in various parts of the world.\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the future research projects on Vietnamese diaspora, the two workshops aim to combine various approaches on researching the diaspora at economically and culturally different localities in Europe, U.S. and East Asia and put together various scholars at various stages of their academic careers focused on Vietnamese migration and diaspora. The ultimate aim is to set up an information exchange platform and a cooperative network that will allow joint research activities and joint publication activities in the future.\n\n**Deadline**\n\nPlease send your presentation proposals (180-300 words long) together with your CV to filip.kraus@upol.cz by **5th November, 2021.**\n\n**Inquiries**For further inquiries, please send an email to: [filip.kraus@upol.cz](mailto:filip.kraus@upol.cz)',title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/ICTs-and-Belonging":{content:"# Information Communication Technology\n#icts #nedelcu\n\n## ICTs mentioned by my informants in Viet Nam\n- Facebook\n- [[Youtube]]\n- LinkedIn\n- Instagram\n- Overseas Vietnamese\n- Spotify\n- ",title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/KKK-and-Viet-Fishermen":{content:"#racism\n#westernhome\n\n* https://www.unclaw.com/chin/scholarship/fishermen.htm\n\n\n* https://timeline.com/kkk-vietnamese-fishermen-beam-43730353df06\n\n\n* https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3024030/vietnamese-refugees-vs-ku-klux-klan-how-racism\n\n\n* https://www.npr.org/2018/11/25/669857481/decades-after-clashing-with-the-klan-a-thriving-vietnamese-community-in-texas\n\n\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/Outward-migration":{content:'# Outward Migration\n\n## Overseas Vietnamese or Viet Kieu\n- Wiki: [Overseas Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Vietnamese)\n- *Overseas Vietnamese* are also often called "[[Viet Kieu]]" or sojourners. \n\n## from Viet Nam\n- [labor migrants](001.Notes/labor%20migrants.md)\n- [An Tuan Nguyen](005.Authors/An%20Tuan%20Nguyen.md)\n\n## to United States\n- Refugees\n	* See [[valverde]]\'s work, specifically [Movement and Meaning](005.Authors/valverde.md#Movement%20and%20Meaning%20also%20see%20rutledge%20002%20Literature%2020Notes%20rutledge%20md) for details of migration waves.\n	* see [rutledge](005.Authors/rutledge.md)\n	* see [Lipman](005.Authors/Lipman.md)\n\n- Entrepreneurs and Intellectuals\n	- see [An Tuan Nguyen](005.Authors/An%20Tuan%20Nguyen.md)\n\n\n## Australia\n- see [Carruthers](005.Authors/Carruthers.md)\n\n## UK\n\n## Canada\n\n## Switzerland\n\n## Germany\n\n## Finland\n\n## Denmark\n\n## Czech\n\n## Russia\n\n## France\n\n## Japan\n- see [labor migrants](001.Notes/labor%20migrants.md)',title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/Viet-Kieu":{content:'# Viet Kieu\n#vk #vietkieu\n\n## Another name for "overseas vietnamese" or Vietnamese sojourners\n- [Sino-Vietnamese](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese "Sino-Vietnamese") word from _[越僑](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B6%8A%E5%83%91#Vietnamese "越僑")_.\n\n- Also termed: \n	- [kiều bào](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ki%E1%BB%81u_b%C3%A0o#Vietnamese "kiều bào")\n	- [đồng bào](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C4%91%E1%BB%93ng_b%C3%A0o#Vietnamese "đồng bào")\n	- [Hoa kiều (ethnic chinese-vietnamese)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoa_ki%E1%BB%81u#Vietnamese "Hoa kiều")',title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/Youtube":{content:"# Youtube\n## \n- \n\n## Resources\n### Vks returning to VN\n- [Video](https://youtu.be/nCGOo0lsnQU) from movetoasia.com\n	- [article link](https://movetoasia.com/en/vietnam/viet-kieu/)\n- \n\n## Literature Notes\n-",title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/authoring-a-phd-by-patrick-dunleary":{content:"Author Patrick Dunleary\n- [Google Books](https://www.google.co.jp/books/edition/Authoring_a_PhD/i-iKOSsdVrkC?hl=ja\u0026gbpv=0)\n- ",title:"Untitled Page"},"/001.Notes/labor-migrants":{content:"# Labor Migrants\n\n## Literature\n### Monograph \n- \n\n### Articles \n- **The State (Viet Nam)**\n- Trần, A.

Consequently, increasing numbers of social scientists have begun calling the emergent migration process in which people live lives stretched across national borders “transnational” (Georges 1990; Kearney 1991a; Sutton 1992a), but the term is often used loosely and without specificity. Frequently the phenomenon of transnationalism is thought to be the outcome of transformations in the technology of communication and transportation, a product of accessible air travel and telecommunications (Wakeman 1988).

While Wallerstein emphasized exchange as the fundamental relationship between the units of the system (Wallerstein 1979), an approach that sees the world as integrated by a global mode of production seems more insightful in explicating the current international division of labor (Laclau 1977; Portes 1978; Portes and Walton 1981; Sassen 1988). \n\n20 d l Page 19 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n21 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 development of transnationalism is a long-term process of global capitalist penetration. \n\n22 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:47 23 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n24 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:46 framework must address link between culture and relations of power and domination since we are looking at culture.

However, in treating culture, the “empowering, authoritative dimensions” must be specified (J. and J.Comaroff 1991:20). Hence our analytical framework must address the link between “culture and relations of power and domination” (Roseberry 1989:25). \n\n25 d l Page 20 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n26 d l Page 21 28/10/2021 14:47 [[hegemony]] is the relationship between those who dominate within the state and those who are dominated. relations are ultimately maintained by force, the social order is sustained by daily practice, habit, and common sense.

The loans and investments were supposed to create, according to donor agencies, development and growth in the “less developed countries.” However, even in their most optimistic projections, development agencies acknowledged that dislocation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate would occur in the early stages of investment (DeWind and McKinney 1986). Disruption of local economies indeed did accompany the most recent wave of intense capital penetration and resulted in an increased pool of available labor as whole families of ten migrated to urban areas. This displaced and underemployed labor could not be easily absorbed by the growing but still relatively small manufacturing sector often dominated by multinationals. The stay of these foreign-capitalized companies has often been short-lived, as firms have moved from country to country in search of even lower labor costs, creating a further displacement of workers. And when workers in locations such as the Caribbean and the \n\n51 d l Page 34 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n52 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:47 it is also these transmigrants who are the first to be kicked out when shit hits the fan. especially if they are identifiable in some way. themselves socially, politically and economically vulnerable, no less in the society they have left than in the one they have joined” (1987:23). Doing better…than they would have done had they stayed at home, they are nevertheless disadvantaged in comparison with members of the indigenous population among whom they live and work, and with whom they are, as newcomers, in unequal competition for jobs and other scarce resources…. As long as they remain identifiable, they will always be in danger. In times of adversity, outsiders make ideal scapegoats. So it is that some of the most explosive popular movements in the contemporary world are directed against minorities which can be identified as ‘immigrant’… And such hostility is usually not just directed at immigrants themselves, but also at their locally born offspring (Ballard 1987:18). Both \n\n53 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n54 d l Page 35 28/10/2021 14:47 great #wording!

Productive of a new imagery, much of this discourse on transnationalism has remained evocative rather than analytical. By linking our definition of transnationalism to migration and rooting our analysis in social relations, we are engaged in a somewhat different, although connected, effort. Our focus becomes the manner in which migrants, through their life ways and daily practices, reconfigure space so that their lives are lived simultaneously within two or more nation-states. \n\n57 d l Page 36 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n58 d l Page 37 28/10/2021 14:46 must look at migrants as active agents in a process of hegemonic construction. network analysis does not look at hegemonic processes of multiple states. instead it just describes connections. Providing us with a clear statement of the ongoing connectedness of migrant ties to “different places,” the call for network analysis focuses our attention on migrants as actors. These formulations, however, do not look at the implications of these networks for the formation of migrant political and social identity, or the complexities of nationalist identifications within transnational social fields. The “spider-web” networks of transmigrants must be located within the hegemonic processes of multiple nation-states, and we must move beyond descriptions of networks to a view of migrants as active agents in a process of hegemonic construction. \n\n59 d l Page 37 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n60 d l Page 38 28/10/2021 14:47 although deteritorialization is being talked about, Basch and Glick Schiller believe that world is divided politically into nation-states that are unequal in their power. Noting the constant penetration of borders, Kearney suggests that we have entered the age of transnationalism, a post-national age in which “members of transnational communities…escape the power of the nation-state to inform their sense of collective identity” (1991a:59). In contrast, we think that the current period, in which the construct of the deterritorialized nation-state is being forcefully articulated, can best be conceived as the moment of a new nationalism. While transmigrants cannot be contained or restrained by national boundaries, the world is still very much divided politically into nation-states that are unequal in their power and that serve differentially as base areas of international capital. \n\n61 d l Page 38 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n62 d l Page 41 28/10/2021 14:47 appadurai speaking about an unboundedness Appadurai, for example, has argued that there is a need to reconceptualize the “landscapes of group identity,” a need that flows from the current world conjuncture in which “groups are no longer tightly territorialized, spatially bounded, historically unselfconscious, or culturally homogeneous” (1991:191). \n\n63 d l Page 41 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n64 d l Page 42 28/10/2021 14:46 we must have a global perspecitive on history and challenge the old ideas and bounded visions of culture and society. A global perspective on history, as well as the contingencies of the current historical conjuncture, challenge us to move beyond bounded visions of culture and society. However, we are often confined by our analytical tool kit of concepts like nation, ethnic group, and tribe that divide the world into autonomous, geographically rooted, and culturally distinct units (Van Binsbergen 1981). These units have been treated as bounded entities, endowed with given, “natural,” and “group-specific” properties. \n\n65 d l Page 42 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n66 d l Page 44 28/10/2021 14:47 Part of the task of this book is to understand the manner in which the conceptual categories of race, ethnicity. and nation are hegemonic constructions and are all part of the historical exercise of state power and domination. With \n\n67 d l Page 44 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n68 d l Page 46 28/10/2021 14:47 The dialectic of simultaneous inclusivity and exclusivity of the nation-state can be understood in relationship to two processes of domination: (1) the mechanisms by which all state societies legitimate structures of power; and (2) the relationship between capital and labor that is at the historical core of nation building projects. \n\n69 d l Page 46 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n70 d l Page 46 28/10/2021 14:46 nationalism as ideology crafted by nation-states to instill idea that it is "fundamental and natural" As with any hegemonic process, specific representations of the nation emerge through active contention in which a country’s leaders and populations both play an active role. Part of nation building is nationalism, the politicized language or ideology of national unity used by those participating in projects of identity construction that focus on the nation. Nationalism is an ideology of identity; part of the ideology is the belief that national identity is fundamental and natural. \n\n71 d l Page 46 28/10/2021 14:47',title:"Untitled Page"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2004.kohPersistentAmbiguitiesVietnamese2004":{content:" [[koh]]\n\n---\ntitle: Persistent ambiguities: Vietnamese ethnology in the Doi Moi period (1986-2001)\nauthors: Priscilla Koh\nyear: 2004\n---\n\n\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2005.brubaker-Diaspora-Diaspora":{content:"\n# Extracted Annotations (2021-12-14)\n\n### p2\n\n\u003e \"proposes to treat diaspora not as a bounded entity but as an idiom, stance and claim.\"([Brubaker 2005:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2))\n\n diaspora as NOT a bounded identity but as an idiom, stance, and claim ([note on p.2) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"Palestinian diaspora, too, has been construed as a 'catastrophic' diaspora/ or in Cohen's (1997) term, a 'victim diaspora'/ on the model of the Jewish case.\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=2)Brubaker 2005:3)\n\n [[cohen]]’s term of [[victim diaspora]] ([note on p.3) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"Some emigrant groups/ characterized as 'long-distance nationalists' by Anderson (1998)/ have been construed as diasporas because of their continued involvement in homeland politics, sometimes involving the support of terrorist or ultra-nationalist movements (Sheffer 1986, 2003; Angoustures and Pascal 1996; Bhatt and Mukta 2000).\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)Brubaker 2005:3)\n\n [[long-distance nationalists]] by [[anderson]] are ‘construed as diasporas’ for their involvement in homeland politics ([note on p.3) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=3)\n\n### p3\n\n\u003e\"In a further extension, the term has come to embrace labour migrants who maintain (to some degree) emotional and social ties with a homeland.

It is this that enables one to speak of a diaspora as a distinctive 'community', held together by a distinctive, active solidarity, as well as by relatively dense social relationships, that cut across state boundaries and link members of the diaspora in different states into a single 'transnational community'.\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)Brubaker 2005:7)\n\n boundary-maintenance as the main criterion of diaspora as it is what links members of diaspora to a single “transnational community” ([note on p.7) ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)\n\n### p7\n\n\u003e\"Although boundary-maintenance and the preservation of identity are ordinarily emphasized, a strong counter-current emphasizes hybridity, fluidity, creolization and syncretism. In an oft-quoted remark by Stuart Hall, the 'diaspora experience... is defined, not by essence or purity, but by the recognition of a necessary heterogeneity and diversity; by a conception of 'identity' which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by hybridity ' (Hall 1990, p. 235, italics original). This counter-current is especially characteristic of the literature on transnationalism, which has tended to fuse in recent years with the literature on diaspora.

This is seldom made explicit, but it is crucial. The erosion of boundaries through assimilation is always a temporally extended, inter-generational process (Alba and Nee 1997, 2003; Brubaker 2001). As a result, boundary maintenance only becomes sociologically interesting, as it were, when it persists over generations. That migrants themselves maintain boundaries is only to be expected; the interesting question, and the question relevant to the existence of a diaspora, is to what extent and in what forms boundaries are maintained by second, third and subsequent generations.\"(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T5QVBU2M?page=7)Brubaker 2005:8)\n\n boundary-making must occur over an extended time. 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent gens.

Such a definition is so broad that it can refer to the possession of material objects, the display of tastes and dispositions, or formal credentials from institutions. The original formulation—from Bourdieu—defined cultural capital as "goods" transmitted to individual children through family practices that were more or less valued depending on how closely they matched the cultural practices deemed important by institutions like schools (see Bourdieu and Passeron 1977:30). Subsequent reworkings by Bourdieu expanded the concept to include generalized understandings of valued forms of knowledge about cultural goods and symbols. This later definition specified cultural capital as a process or "an act of deciphering, decoding, which presupposes practical or explicit mastery of a cipher or code" (Bourdieu 1984:2). Cultural capital can thus refer to innumerable practices, for example, "table manners or the art of conversation, musical culture or the sense of propriety, playing tennis or pronunciation" (Bourdieu 1984:70), but practices can be identified as cultural capital only in their relationship to other practices that are more or less valued in a specific context.1 The implication is that the logic of valuation—what makes a particular practice valuable in relation to other practices—is not universal and is, in fact, largely arbitrary."([Besbris.Khan 2017:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DGFXZBI?page=3))\n\n definition by [[bourdieu]] as “goods” transferred to children through family practices that were more or less valued depending on how much they were deemed important by institutions.

Economic capital has a somewhat unique quality compared with other kinds of capital: It is ambivalent to its holder.

They use their association with baseball to draw boundaries that are important to them and to gain power and status in their lives in the same ways. Given the money analogy, their cultural association with baseball should produce similar effects on their overall life chances. But imagine that one of these people is a man and the other is a woman. Suddenly the value of their cultural capital is different. Not because of any difference in cultural capital per se but because of the status of its holder.

Instead, Stuart Hall (2008: 346) speaks of ‘cosmopolitanism from below’: There is a ‘cosmopolitanism of the above’ – global entrepreneurs following the pathways of global corporate power and the circuits of global investment and capital, who can’t tell which airport they’re in, because they all look the same, and who have apartments in three continents. This is global [[cosmopolitanism]] of a very limited kind but it is very different from ‘cosmopolitanism from below’ – people driven across borders, obliged to uproot themselves from home, place and family, living in transit camps or climbing on to the backs of lorries or leaky boats or the bottom of trains and airplanes, to get to somewhere else. Both of them are forms of globalization and, in so far as they both interact within the same global sphere, are deeply interconnected with one another.

Hence he launches into a trenchant critique against diasporic intellectuals who speak ‘in the name of mixture and hybridity, a claim to a humanity so fused in its cultural characteristics that no “ethnic absolutism” is possible’ (Friedman 1997: 75–6). The celebration of hybridity, in-betweenness or double consciousness by diasporic poets, artists and intellectu- als proves to be a self-interested strategy, divorced from working-class migrants’ (or indigenous people’s) predicaments and concerns. For the urban poor, he claims, ‘class identity, local ghetto identity, tend to prevail’, leaving ‘little room for the hybrid identifications discussed and pleaded for by cultural elites’ (Friedman 1997: 84). Cultural self-identifications are, ultimately, Friedman argues, like those of class or gender, a matter of social position (Friedman 1997: 88).

Diasporas that share the same culture, language and/or religion will likely be more diasporic than those that do not. Despite being scattered geographically, such cultural commonalities and shared religious faith can produce ethnic solidarity across national borders that produces a stronger collective identification as members of a cohesive diasporic community. They can also facilitate communication across national borders, which is essential to transnational diasporic social rela- tions.

When displaced ethnic commu- nities face considerable socio-economic and ethnic exclusion or persecution, they may become more diasporic by relying more on their transnational ethnic linkages with the homeland and to others in the diaspora as a means to obtain resources, social status and belonging denied them in the host society. In fact, a number of scholars have emphasized how diasporic peoples tend not to be assimilated and socially integrated in the host society and face social marginalization and discrimination (Brubaker 2005: 6; Cohen 1997: 186; Parreñas and Siu 2007: 13; Safran 1991: 83; Shuval 2000: 44). In contrast, other dispersed ethnic groups have become cultural and socially assimilated to their host countries over time, which can lead to an attenuation of their trans- national, diasporic connections to homelands and co-ethnic communities abroad. However, a growing number of studies have also documented how the assimilation of immigrants and their descendants is not necessarily incompatible with their continued transnational involvement in countries \n\n27 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n28 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:47 \u003cmark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"\u003ehowever, assimilation of 1st generation does not mean that 2nd generation will not have continued transnational ties with countries of ethnic origin. \u003c/mark\u003e incompatible with their continued transnational involvement in countries of ethnic origin (see Tsuda 2012b for a discussion). \n\n29 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n30 d l Page 211 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n31 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:46 \n\n32 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:46 diasporicity of japanese is relatively low due to being a relatively older diaspora and being more assimilated with each other. lateral ethnic affiliations are also weak. Despite their migratory dispersal from the Japanese homeland to predominantly one part of the world, diasporic nikkei communities in the Americas have a relatively low level of diasporicity for a number of reasons. Because they are an older diaspora, their centripetal transnational ties to Japan have generally weakened over time, and they have also not devel- oped notable lateral ethnic connections and affiliations with each other (Tsuda 2016: 261–8; White 2003: 316). Unlike newer, first-generation diasporas, these dispersed populations of Japanese-descent nikkeijin are generations old and have assimilated to their respective host societies, which has led to the attenuation of both their homeland diasporicity and their transnational ethnic connections to Japanese descent communities elsewhere in the Americas. \n\n33 d l Page 212 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n34 d l Page 213 28/10/2021 14:47 \u003cmark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"\u003ewestern countries positioned high in geopolitical power have less interest in countries below them. thus, japanese americans less interested in brazilian japanese. in contrast japanese brazilians are much more aware of japanese americans because they see the US as a powerful country in the americas and has impact on the region. \u003c/mark\u003e In addition to their low homeland diasporicity, Japanese Americans do not have any notable lateral transnational ties with Japanese descendants in other countries and have little awareness of them, especially those living in South America (see Tsuda 2016: chapter 8). Because the host country of the Japanese Americans is positioned at the top of the global geopolitical and economic order, they seem to have less interest in Japanese Brazilians and other South American nikkei, who are positioned lower in the diaspora (just as Americans in general have less interest and knowledge about South America because of its lower significance for them). In contrast, Japanese Brazilians are much more aware of Japanese Americans because they (like other Brazilians) focus their attention on the United States, which is the most powerful country in the Americas and has a significant impact on the entire region. \n\n35 d l Page 213 28/10/2021 14:47 \n\n36 d l Page 214 28/10/2021 14:47 diasporicity can be used to examine internal differences in a diaspora based on nationality, gender, or immigrant generation. The concept of diasporicity can therefore be used to compare different diasporic groups as well as examine internal differences in a diaspora based on nationality, gender or immi- grant generation. There are undoubtedly many reasons why certain diasporic peoples have stronger transnational connections and communities than others, which are related to the causes of their diasporic dispersal, their level of cultural similarity, their marginalization and discrimination from host societies, and the amount of time they have been living in the diaspora. In this way, diasporicity provides a framework for researchers to empirically assess, compare and explain the characteristics of transnational ethnic groups constituted by migratory dispersal. \n\n37 d l Page 214 28/10/2021 14:46 38 d l Page 294',title:"Untitled Page"},"/002.Literature-Notes/2019.erel-Migrant-Capitals-Proposing":{content:'# Extracted Annotations (2021-12-14)\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "Migrants routinely experience a mismatch between the spatial contexts where their resources were formed and the new contexts where they look to validate these as capitals."([Erel.Ryan 2019:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D68D6QSX?page=3))\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "Combining the macro-level factors of economic and political structures, the meso-level of networks with the micro-level of personal narratives, the article proposes that such a multi-level analytic framework, that is sensitive to temporal and spatial dynamics, is useful in highlighting the fractures, hierarchies and exclusions in specific fields."([Erel.Ryan 2019:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D68D6QSX?page=3))\n\n### p248\n\n\u003e "We propose that such a spatio-temporal multi-level analysis can also highlight migrants\' agency and strategies to mobilize resources as capitals; building new capitals in new places.

Similar to Wang’s (2017: 1175) description of the gendered return experiences of American-born Chinese, a mixture of Socialist egalitarianism and Confucian patri- archal concepts influence the return mobilities of the interlocutors of this study. In line with the Vietnamese tradition of patrilineal ancestor worship, sons (i.e. men) are considered to be “inside lineage” (bên nô. i) thus holding inherent morality, honour and reputation (Rydstrom 2002: 360), while women are thought to be related to the “outside lineage” (bên ngoa. i). This gender dichotomy is also applied to the concep- tion of character traits of men and women in Vietnam. The characters of women are described as cold (tính la. nh), which is opposed to the hot character (tính nóng) of men. Due to this inherent “heat” of men, it is generally accepted that they cross moral borders more easily or behave dangerously. Examples of this can be found in excessive alcohol consumption, drunken participation in traffic, gambling or sexual adventures and prostitution. Nguy˜ên and Harris, for example, conclude that “Sexuality is one of the main components of a Vietnamese real ‘man’ […]. Therefore, seeking sex workers is considered a rite of passage: married men will take unmarried men to houses of prostitution to initiate their transformation into ‘real’ men” (2009: 136). Due to their status as being perceived outside the patrilineal family, daughters and women are expected to continuously show moral behaviour and adhere to strict ethical conduct (Rydstrom 2002: 260).

The one thing that they have in common is that all of them have Vietnamese roots, but they were born or raised in Western countries[[1]](#_ftn1). In their 20s or 30s, they decide to experience living in Vietnam. \n\nThis study tries to answer what factors shape the return of Vietnamese heritage westerners back to Vietnam and explores their experiences in regards to the integration into Vietnamese society. Although it is early to form the final conclusions, the preliminary analysis suggests many possible factors shape the return of Vietnamese westerners. Maybe, it is possible to classify them into three types of factors: individual (personal), social (interactional), and external (environmental). \n\nIndividual factors can be “a quest for identity”, social can be “a Viet Kieu/expat community in Vietnam” and external can be “globalization/modernization/technology (ICT)”. However, there are yet fifteen more interviews to code, as well as to process the already developed codes and merge them into categories and themes. \n\nThe respondents faced many identity issues while growing up (among other things, because they looked different than the majority or because of conflict between fitting into Western cultural heritage and being raised with Vietnamese cultural values). They sometimes experienced racism, discrimination, and bullying. They had to put extra effort to fit in and become accepted as a regular part of a community. What is interesting is that when respondents came to Vietnam, they again experienced similar issues as in their countries of birth. They were seen as Westerners or foreigners, they looked different, they could not fit in with Vietnamese traditional cultural values, and overall, they could not connect with the mindset of local Vietnamese. In my opinion, this is the most interesting aspect of this research, and deconstructing it can benefit with some very interesting findings. It is interesting to focus on how Vietnamese heritage westerners who moved to Vietnam react to this, and how it helps them to reconsider, rebuild, or accept their identity. \n\nThe other interesting aspect of the study is that it shows that Vietnamese westerners who moved to Vietnam usually stay in social circles that include other Viet Kieu's (or other foreign ex-pats). This can also be connected with identity, as although Vietnamese westerners come from many different countries, they still have a lot in common. First of all, the same Vietnamese heritage, identity issues that are characteristic for the second generation of Vietnamese westerners (feeling half, feeling split, being in the middle, balancing identities) and other struggles (racism/discrimination, language issues, family issues, etc.) they had while growing up are similar for all of them. The identity of the second-generation Vietnamese seems to be very different from the identity of first-generation Vietnamese who immigrated to Western countries, the major population of their birth country, as well as of Vietnamese who never left Vietnam. This places Viet Kieu identity as a distinct category of (inter)national identities. This can be brought in the connection with newly emerging identities that are being formed in our (post)modern society that is characterized by the global movement of capital, people, and symbols. It would be good to explore this Viet Kieu identity even further and to understand how it differs from traditional (national) identities. \n\nIt is also important to put some focus on the effects of globalization, modernization, and technological advancements (which is also connected with the Viet Kieu / ex-pat community in Vietnam). For example, it can be argued that the second generation of Vietnamese westerners comes to Vietnam because of its modernization and job opportunities. The respondents are usually highly educated and came to Vietnam to work for international companies. This allowed them to explore their roots, reconnect with family they have in Vietnam, travel, while they could also get international work experience and improve their careers. They realize that Vietnam is changing and they come there to be a part of Vietnam’s growth. For example, they promote businesses, try to improve the education system, and help certain groups such as underprivileged girls. They are also “rebranding” Vietnam through posting audio-visual content on social networks and internet, showing to the world that Vietnam changed and in that way, attracting other Vietnamese who were born in western countries to come to Vietnam, as well as tourists and expats. \n\nICTs also play a big role in making the life of Vietnamese returnees easier. First of all, they allow them to stay in touch (through instant chats, video calls, and other means of internet communication) with their parents and friends who stayed in their birth countries. Additionally, ICTs help them to connect with people of similar interests and build new social networks in Vietnam. For example, there are many Viet Kieu groups where returnees can find different types of information that can make their first weeks/months in Vietnam easier. Also, they use online groups and networks to connect with people of similar interests, to find events they can attend, and to build new social networks. It might be argued that ICTs allow returnees to live in Vietnam without fully integrating. Through the internet and ICTs, they can easily stay in the Viet Kieu/Expat social bubble, shop or order food online, and generally stay disconnected from the local Vietnamese society while still being a part of it. \n\nIn conclusion, this study can provide some interesting observations on how identities are formed in the contemporary world. It shows how identity can be deconstructed, reconsidered, reinvented, and accepted. It shows how traditional notions of identity that are based on ethnicity or nationality transform into other types of identities that are more global, international, or hybrid. On a micro-scale, this is a story about the second-generation of Vietnamese westerners, about their personal and social struggles, as well as about approaches for overcoming them. Finally, it is also a story about Vietnam going through a change. Vietnamese westerners, although not fully integrated into Vietnamese society, and often in disjunction with traditional Vietnamese cultural values, represent the new drive of Vietnam’s modernization and their return to Vietnam will probably have important effects on the further economic and cultural transformation of Vietnam.",title:"Untitled Page"},"/010.Qualitative-Data/020.coding-notes":{content:'ATLAS.ti 9 project bundle, networks of potential categories, grounded theory methodology paper, and preliminary analysis writing.  \nIn Atlas.ti file, there are 753 codes divided by 5 major code groups: \n\n1.

How do we minimize the friction of taking notes in a PDF document and turning those into evergreen, permanent notes?\n\nThose were the exact questions I was asking myself a few days ago. Reading research papers was a mess. I had no good way to import my highlighted notes to my note system, and the only good way didn't do everything I needed it to.\n\nSo I created my own system for reading research papers; a combination of [Zotero](https://zotero.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Let me show you what I made, and how it can help you.\n\n**Process outline**\n\n1.  Add paper to Zotero inbox\n2.  Read the paper when I have time — and take notes\n3.  Automatically ingest it into Obsidian with the desired template and metadata\n4.  Processing the notes; creating literature notes, and turning those into permanent notes\n\nIn this article, I'll show you 1-3. Later, I'll show you how I process what I've read, turning them into literature notes, and finally, permanent notes.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\n## Setting up Zotero\n\nThe process always starts with me adding a paper to my Zotero inbox. [Learn how to maintain your Inbox and keep it clutter-free.](https://bagerbach.com/blog/how-i-process-inputs-from-the-internet/)\n\nI use the [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) extension to save papers directly to Zotero from my browser. You can also use the magic wand button in Zotero to add papers by their DOI.\n\nI use the new built-in PDF reader for Zotero, which allows me to extract annotations in a certain way. If you don't use it, you can use [Zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile) to extract annotations directly from the PDF, and they will still be inserted into the note.\n\nTo summarize; if you take notes with Zotero, extract the annotations through the right-click menu, and they'll be inserted into the note we're creating later. If you are taking notes directly in your PDF, you should use Zotfile to extract the annotations - and these will also be included when you create a new note. You can extract annotations with Zotfile by right-clicking the PDF in Zotero, clicking `Manage Attachments`, and then `Extract Annotations`.\n\n## Setting up Obsidian\n\nTo enable the workflow on Obsidian, you'll need the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin. Check out my video [here](https://youtu.be/gYK3VDQsZJo) for how it works. You will also need the [Citations](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) plugin. To set up Citations, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin#setup).\n\nNow, let's set up the template.\n\n### My research paper template\n\nThe following is the template I use for papers. I use [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), so my metadata looks a bit different from the conventional YAML.\n\n````\n---\ntags: in/paper state/process\naliases:\n  - {{VALUE:title}}\ncssclass: null\nabstract: \u003e\n  {{VALUE:abstract}}\n---\n\n# {{VALUE:title}}\n\n---\nType:: [[\u0026]]\nTitle:: {{VALUE:title}}\nAuthor:: {{VALUE:author}}\nYear:: {{VALUE:year}}\nTags:: \nDOI:: {{VALUE:doi}}\nCitekey:: {{VALUE:id}}\nZoteroURI:: [Open in Zotero: {{VALUE:title}}]({{VALUE:zoteroSelectURI}})\nReviewedDate:: [[{{DATE:gggg-MM-DD - ddd MMM D}}]]\nRating:: ==Give a rating==\n\n---\n\n## Citation\n```latex\n\n```\n\n## Abstract\n{{VALUE:abstract}}\n\n## Summary of key points\n- \n\n## Other Comments\n-\n\n## Interesting Cited References \n- \n\n---\n{{VALUE:note}}\n````\n\nEvery metadata property will be filled out by QuickAdd, except the tags and rating. Notably, the `ZoteroURI` property will contain a link which, when clicked, will open Zotero with the target paper selected. The `ReviewedDate` property will link to my daily note. Besides those, the remaining properties will just contain data about the paper itself. Something I quite like is that the script automatically links to the author(s) with WikiLinks.\n\n### Setting up QuickAdd\n\nWe'll need to install a QuickAdd user script for this to work. The video shows you how to do so [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK3VDQsZJo\u0026t=1730s). You can grab the script [here](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Attachments/citationsManager.js).\n\nAt this point, we need to create a macro — if you haven't already. In QuickAdd, go to Manage Macros, and add a new macro. Once the macro has been added, go ahead and click Configure. You'll want to add the user script to the macro — I called it 'citationsManager'.\n\nNow, add a Template to the macro by clicking the Template button. My Template Choice looks like this:\n\n![Template choice](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210818160734.png)\n\nAnd you can't see it in the image, but I have Open enabled. Here's an explanation of the settings:\n\n-   **Template Path** is the path to my template. I'll share that with you in a moment.\n-   **File Name Format** is the format of my file names. I use \u0026 in front of papers for my file convention. The `{{VALUE:title}}` is necessary, as it grabs the paper's title and uses that — which happens through the script.\n-   I use **create in folder** because I put my source notes in an inputs folder.\n-   And lastly, **open**, which isn't visible. This is used to open the created file.\n\nThis is what your macro should look like.\n\n![Macro](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210816155927.png)\n\nHaving created the macro, all you need is a QuickAdd choice to activate it. Back in the main QuickAdd menu, add a Choice of the Macro type. Click ⚙ settings for it and select your newly created macro.\n\n## Creating notes in Obsidian from papers in Zotero\n\nNow that we're all set up, it's time to use the script!\n\nHaving read a paper, I'll go into Obsidian and activate the `📜 Add Paper` choice. A menu like this will open:\n\n![](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819164144.png)\n\nSelecting a paper will create a new note, which looks like this:\n\n![Created note](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819164254.png)\n\nThis paper has no DOI, which would otherwise be filled out.\n\nSo there it is. This is how I import papers into my vault; notes, metadata, and all.\n\n## How you can use it\n\nAny of the following variables can be accessed with `{{VALUE:variable}}`, where `variable` is the name of the variable. Most of these are from the Citations plugin, but I've added a few extra ones for convenience.\n\nThese can be used in your Template Choice as well as your markdown template.\n\n-   `fileName` — paper title with all the special, illegal characters removed\n-   `citekey`\n-   `id` — also citekey\n-   `author` — all authors in linked format\n-   `doi` and `DOI`\n-   `abstract`\n-   `authorString`\n-   `containerTitle`\n-   `eprint`\n-   `eprinttype`\n-   `eventPlace`\n-   `note`\n-   `page`\n-   `publisher`\n-   `publisherPlace`\n-   `title`\n-   `URL`\n-   `year`\n-   `zoteroSelectURI`\n-   `type`\n-   `issueDate`\n\nYou can go into settings for the script and toggle force ignore of any empty properties. This means that, any properties that are undefined will be empty and won't be prompted for.\n\n![Script settings](https://bagerbach.com/uploads/pasted-image-20210819165815.png)\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nAny questions, requests, or otherwise?

Instead, it is a continuous, ongoing transnational process, especially for diasporic peoples, which involves not only further migration to other countries after their initial migratory dispersal from the homeland, but also migratory returns back to the homeland."('}],"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=17":[{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=17",text:"note on p.17)"},{source:"/002.Literature Notes/2019.tsudaDiasporicReturnsEthnic",target:"/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZATNCL67?page=17",text:'"We adopt an inclusive perspective that encompasses the considerable diversity of diasporic returns by examining different types of migratory returnees from various countries in South Korea and other Asian homelands.
