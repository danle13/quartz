### Panel Description

The changing nature of the international Vietnamese diaspora can be largely attributed to a growth in transnational migration from Vietnam since the launch of the Đổi mới reform in the late 1980s. This has included two main categories - labour migration and international student migration. In 2018, contract labour migrants numbered 500,000, the majority of which were hosted in Taiwan, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Irregular migration has also constituted an important form of labour migration, without reliable statistical data, qualitative research indicates significant volumes of cross-border migration to China and Southeast Asia as well as temporary migration to Europe and Northern Africa. The number of Vietnamese students overseas in 2020 reached 190,000, according to The Ministry of Education and Training, placing Vietnam in the top ten biggest student sending countries in the world (destined mainly for United States, Australia, and Canada). These unprecedented opportunities for migration and mobility raise important questions about the on-going changes in Vietnamese diasporic communities, the proliferation of transnational networks and the shifting nature of citizenship and belonging. Citizenship is processual and performative. Belonging, on the other hand, is not fixed or ahistorical but subject to displacement by changing social, economic, and political circumstances.

This panel will offer reflections on the relationship between established diasporas and newer migrant communities in the Vietnamese diaspora according to networks, citizenship and belonging. Our presentations will be focused on, but not restricted to, the following questions:

- How have recent patterns of Vietnamese migration transformed social relations within and between established Vietnamese diaspora communities?

	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">new media (ICTs) as a space where migrants find community. With the emergence of new media, it is no longer simple to define localities as physical spaces</mark> 
- How are the changing policies towards migrants in various ‘host’ societies reshaping the contours and experiences of the Vietnamese migrants and the diaspora in specific national contexts?

	- the way that 2nd and subsequent generations are treated in settlement countries foreshadows what viet economic/labor migrants may face there. racism and discrimination as factors contributing to moving back
	- Matas illustrates that policy racism (or official racism) might start from restrictions in visa requirements where nationals of some countries are required to have visas in order to enter a country, whereas others enter visa-free. 1 [This article.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021934716680323)
		- loan, 
	- Also, nationals of some countries are put under strict secondary examination at the ports of entry as well as frequent checks (ethnic profiling) within the host society, whereas nationals of others are not. Also, refugee claimants from some countries are easily accepted and granted refugee status, while others, fleeing the same or similar oppressions, repressions, or violence, are quickly refused (Matas, 1994, p. 15).
	- Belonging involves ‘the desire for some sort of attachment, be it to other people, places or modes of being’ (Probyn 1996, 19). [From this article.](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/152936/1/152936.pdf)
		- According to Agnew, places are fixed or mobile locations that have a real material or imaginary form and further possess a ‘sense of place’, which is the emotional and subjective attachment individuals have to it (Cresswell 2004, 7). Thus, a sense of place may give rise to reflections and interpretations of rootedness and heritage and so provides attachments to certain locations. Places that affect humans’ sense of belonging are those in which people feel comfortable or at home. Such places are found at various scales, such as the domestic, the local, the regional, the national, and even the supranational levels (Rose 1995, 88–91). These may be neighbourhoods, villages, regions, nation-states, or even larger entities. Direct personal interaction with these may bring about the negotiation of allegiances (Gustafson 2009, 492).

- What implications does increased mobility have for Vietnamese transnational subjects’ on-going power struggles within nation-states over recognition and identity?
